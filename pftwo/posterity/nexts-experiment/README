I experimented with the num_nexts parameter, which determines how many
different sequences to try before taking the best one. Each experiment
ran for about 2 hours (fixed number of nes frames). My conclusion
was that it doesn't really matter (or that I need to run much longer
in order to tell), but I settled on 6.7 since it was the winner and
numbers in that range seemed to perform as good as anything.
