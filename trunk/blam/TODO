It occurs to me that if we don't need to record the actual match but
only its score, then we don't need to allocate n1*n2 space; instead we
can get by with 2*min(n1, n2) space. wlog assuming s1 is shorter, simply
allocate two arrays of length n1. We maintain the invariant that the first
of these two arrays is filled in (this can be done in the base case easily)
and then compute the second. Note that we always know the first element of
the new array, and then the rest of the cells only depend on the previous
row. This should take the memory allocation down a lot, at a minimum.

(Actually, it also seems that we can fit this all in typical L1 caches;
even assuming an array of size 5000, that's only 20kb for each of our two
lines!!)


  ... done!
