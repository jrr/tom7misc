HTML5Game TODO:

 - Drums in MIDI support!

 - Would be nice if we could build resources directly into
   javascript, like as encoded base64 (or even some fancier
   compression). Then we could build the game with some
   makefile and not need a web server.

 - Box2d integration / example?!

 - cutscene support

 - fix audio policy:

 - currently need to poll, so just do this in each animation frame
   to see if state has changed; then dispatch to key commands.

 - how to rumble in chrome (experimental):
 gamepad.vibrationActuator.playEffect("dual-rumble",
  {duration: 500, strongMagnitude: 1.0, weakMagnitude: 1.0});
