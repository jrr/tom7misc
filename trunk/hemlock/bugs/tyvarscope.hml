(* in Elaborator.elabd, tyvar scope from a val dec extends beyond
   the expressions because we just stick them into the context,
   which gets modified and returned. 

   There's nothing unsound about this (as far as I know), but it's
   different from the way SML works, and maybe kind of stupid.
   (On the other hand, it may be a nice tool for type anotations;
   I don't know!)

*)

let val a s = 1
in s : a
end
