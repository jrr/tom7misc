* frontend
** make 'a task vs 'a job (client/cord distinction)

* propositional logic prover demo
** parse proposition?
** need the 'i' in IO

* exceptions
** fix marshaller/unmarshaller (yech)
** default exn handler
   can this be installed in the CPS language or later
   so as to avoid TAL hacking??

* cleanup
** shut up pophooks, etc. except on error or flag
** get rid of debugging prints
** Fix absolute pathnames all over
   (mainly compile.sml, parse.sml, makefiles, runtime/makefile)
** 80 char line widths ("make linelen")
*** talend/total.sml : 130
*** talend/runtime.sml : 86
*** compile.sml : 119

* Pattern compiler
** constants

* optimizations
** known sumswitch
  I thought I already do this, but it doesn't seem to work. If we
  know the value of a sum, we can reduce a sumswitch on it.

** unit erasure
  how ?? has to be type-directed, I believe.

** sethandler..sethandler in same block
  the first can always be removed unless there is a gethandler
  intervening (this comes up in handle-intensive code after inlining,
  and removing the first set would probably make its handler dead,
  which is nice)

** sethandler..gethandler in same block
  this is probably rare unless the programmer uses exn raises
  as 'gotos'

* bugs/*

* Fix insecure/sloppy use of /tmp
   (compile.sml)
