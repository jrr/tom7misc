  (* Optimizations TODO:
     - Reuse temporaries.
     - Replace locals with temporaries
        (Should this be done in CIL though? Can't do it for
         stuff that spans blocks there.)
        (Is it even faster, anyway? I guess it would cut
         down on moves between locals and "registers")
     - A handful of operators can use immediate values, at
       least printable ones. *)

  (* Notes on translation strategy:

     - The comparison operators are some trouble; we don't
       something like cmov, so we have to do a compare-
       and-jump in order to compute the values. (It would
       maybe be possible to subtract and check the sign
       bit manually, but it's pretty fiddly.) So one of the
       things that the CIL optimizer does is rewrite
       comparison expressions like "a < b" to the condition
       forms, like gotoif (a < b).

     - all temporaries are either 16 or 32 bits.
       many 8-bit operations are available to us, but
       it adds lots of complexity.
