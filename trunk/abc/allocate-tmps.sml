  (* Optimize the temporaries by coalescing two temporaries
     that don't interfere. There are two important goals:
       - Remove MOV instructions where possible:
           mov dst, src
         can be made into a no-op (i.e., dropped) if dst and
         src are actually the same temporary.
       - Reduce the total number of temporaries in a frame
         so that it fits within printable offsets of EBP.

     These are both achieved by identifying two temporaries
     that can be safely coalesced, and making them the same.
     To make two temporaries the same, we just pick one and
     substitute the other for it everywhere. Because the
     liveness analysis is not easily transformed back into
     blocks, we substitute through cmds, the in/out sets,
     and the blocks. *)
