breakpoint near end with JNO thing: 01FE:FCCC

With long COM files, it gets loaded into memory and then some
instructions at the high end of the segment get overwritten
there seems to always be an illegal instruction at 0xFD38.

we have
0xFD38:   00 4B FF      add [bp+di-01],cl (illegal?)
          00 20         add [bx+si],ah

          71 7e         JNO +7e ...
          71 7e         JNO +7e ...
       ... this appears now to continue with my binary.

0x10001   00 00  zeroes forever?
          00 00
          00 00

When I did a short jump past 0xFFFF, it did wrap around to 01FE:004C,
but since the range 00-FF contains garbage (including INT21 RETF,
it jumps off into nothings).

OK, so 0xFD38+ contains garbage only (?) if you execute a DOS
interrupt--otherwise it's got my program up there just as I left it.
So if we could prevent this, or predict it, I think we're good.
"direct console output 0x06" and "output to stdout 0x02" both
modify this region. :/
uh actually j/k, even with NOP NOP, there's garbage up here?

Here's the source code
https://fossies.org/linux/dosbox/src/dos/dos_execute.cpp

In dosbox source file, is this part buggy?
  370     if (iscom) {    /* COM Load 64k - 256 bytes max */
  371         pos=0;DOS_SeekFile(fhandle,&pos,DOS_SEEK_SET);  
  372         readsize=0xffff-256;
  373         DOS_ReadFile(fhandle,loadbuf,&readsize);
  374         MEM_BlockWrite(loadaddress,loadbuf,readsize);
 ... should it be readsize = 0x10000 - 256?
  (I always make this same kinda bug)
  (But that would only drop 1 byte)

TODO, look at
 - SetupPSP
 - SetupCMDLine

Maybe it is the stack coexisting with my program
  413         csip=RealMake(pspseg,0x100);
  414         sssp=RealMake(pspseg,0xfffe);
  415         mem_writew(PhysMake(pspseg,0xfffe),0);
(indeed SS=01FE.
 but who put stuff in my stack?!
 Note that even BIOS interrupts mess with the stack. :/)

Yes, it looks like PUSH will overwrite this high area of memory.

So we have to either
 - Use self-modifying code
 - Rely on the contents of this section being kinda corrupted and
   jump over it
 - Clean up high memory with a bunch of PUSH stuff
 - Use EXE format, where SP can point elsewhere

Note that we would likely need to avoid using the stack if we
try to keep this memory area clean :/

In a COM file, the first 256 bytes contain potentially useful stuff:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_Segment_Prefix

For example, we know that 0x50-0x52 does a DOS interrupt and then a
RETF, so if we could manage to jump here (with a good value on the
stack), we can do an interrupt without self-modifying code (!).
There are also 127 bytes of verbatim command-line data (could require
the program to be invoked with a certain command line?!)


EXE format
 - with header at r3012, cs=220D (has my code in it), IP=2020
   SS=705B (blank, ESP=7e7e, but this still gives us 32kb stack)
   FS=GS=0
   ESI=2020 (what is it?)
   EDI=7e7e (what is it?)
   ES=DS=01DD. Starts with 256 bytes of not my program; I think
               it is the PSP?
   Note that the code segment does NOT start with this.          

ascii

"trivial" with self-modifying code. Just a small boot-loader that
decodes regular x86 code from e.g. base64 or hex encoding. (This is
still hard because all the modern headers use zeroes?)




Control.Print.printDepth := 100;

Some crazy ideas:
 - Can we use the relocation table to modify our binary in a
   predictable way at startup?


Comprehensive opcode encoding reference:
http://ref.x86asm.net/geek32.html


Printable characters are 0x20 (space) through 0x7e (~), inclusive,
plus maybe 0x0D (CR), 0x0A (LF), 0x09 (TAB).


0x0A, 0x0D, 0x09 are all OR opcodes.

Tricks:
 - Though we have some limitations in the encoding of register
   targets, we can permute/copy between registers using the
   PUSH and POP instructions (0x50+r, 0x58+r).
 - Loading literals:
      XOR REG, REG
      XOR REG, IMM   (8, 16, 32 bits possible)
      there is also PUSH of immediates
 - Math:
     We have IMUL, phew.
     DIV we'll have to do in software (don't even have shifts for
     division by power of two)
     ADD (a, b) is the same as SUB (a, -b) as long as 
 - Bitwise complement:
     XOR REG, REG
     DEC REG  // now 0xFFFFFFFF
     XOR REG, REG2
 - Unconditional jumps:
   - JNO jumps if the overflow flag is cleared.
   - XOR EAX, 0x20; XOR EAX, 0x20 preserves register values and
     always clears the overflow (and carry) flags. It wrecks
     other flags, though.
 - BOUND can maybe be used to exit? triggers exception (INT 5)
   "Thank you for playing wing commander."

   IN, OUTS
 - It looks possible to blink PS/2 LEDs for output:
   http://wiki.osdev.org/PS/2_Keyboard
   as well as probably read scancodes!

  decent documentation:
   http://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/OUTS:OUTSB:OUTSW:OUTSD.html
   http://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_141.html
  PC speaker:
   http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/23986-generating-sound-in-assembly/
  Covox Speech Thing is just DAC on the parallel port; DOSBox
  emulates it. Parallel port is pretty easy with IN/OUT:
   http://wiki.osdev.org/Parallel_port
  Adlib:
   http://bespin.org/~qz/pc-gpe/adlib.txt

 - OUTS looks pretty general; it takes the IO port from DX and
   the value from memory (specified in DS:ESI).

Notable missing opcodes:
 - MOV. Ugh. Need this for...
     - loading literals
     - moving between registers
     - loading from and storing to memory
   ... looks like XOR with a memory operand and register known to
       contain 0 will work for loads and stores, though?
 - DIV and IDIV. Will need to do division in software, I guess.
 - CALL and RET. While it's not a big deal to manually jump indirect
   with JMP [eax] (etc.), it looks like reading the EIP register
   might be difficult. Fortunately, if we know where we are located
   in memory, the return address is a constant. (But actually we only
   have short immediate jumps forward, ugh)
 - INT. Used to make DOS system calls, which might be important
   for setting up "unreal mode" (not to mention basic IO in DOS).
   Probably only workaround for this is self-modifying code.
   (but there is an INT 21 in the PSP...)
 - SHL and SHR, which are used all over the place. Since we also
   don't have ADD, this could make some normally easy
   things quite hard. Hmm. (We do have IMUL, INC and SUB, and can
   do bitwise complement with XOR. SHL is a series of self-adds.)
 - NOT, NEG. Can do this with XOR, deg (flags notwithstanding)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
          unsolved!
          
 - POP CS (actually 0f was an 8086/88-specific opcode?)
   MOV CS, AX -- seems to need opcode 8e, and XOR/AND trick doesn't
   assemble (would be hard anyway because code would jump to 0000
   immediately I think)
   I think this is necessary for more than 64k of
   code, and to use the INT 21 RETF in DS... are there other ways?
   (COM file would not have this problem btw)

We can do dynamic jumps (maybe) by modifying the IVT (using FS or GS
prefix -- are these segments guaranteed to be zero?) and then
performing illegal instructions. This lets us set CS and IP, but there
are some major limitations:
  - The stack will contain the address of the instruction that
    faulted (not the one following it), so IRET just loops.
  - The fault clears the interrupt flag, and only STI, POPF and
    IRET can reset the flag. (And it looks like the illegal
    opcode won't jump if IF=0.)
One solution would be to send to some code that already contains
an IRET. This would be great if we could adjust the stack to
contain a useful value (e.g. POP AX; INC AX; INC AX; PUSH AX,
though this destroys ax so..). Since we know where the interrupt
handlers are (by reading the IVT), we could maybe insert this
code (it's all printable) before the IVT and then jump there
instead. But I don't think there's any way to modify arbitrary
segment:offset values (the interrupt handler could be anywhere)
without the instructions that modify segment registers (eg POP ES).

Might be possible to send control flow into the PSP (but can we
even figure out what DS is? Perhaps using the relocation table?). Some
interesting parts:
  - DS:002B has "call near bx". This could maybe jump into arguments
    supplied on the command line, but everything would have to be
    printable (though at this point we have the ability to modify
    the stack, like we could do
        // Get rid of the return addr from that call
        POP AX;
        // Adjust the return pointer for the interrupt call
        POP AX; INC AX; INC AX; PUSH AX
        ... now somehow jump (not INT/CALL) to the interrupt handler ...
        ??
    ... or actually why not just jump into the PSP, not using that
    CALL NEAR BX? (And in that case, it need not be PSP, it can just
    be some code that we loaded anywhere.)


.. and don't forget the possibility of jumping mid-instruction.

OTOH, we CAN at least use this technique to "cleanly" exit the
program, since that interrupt does not return.

Inefficient but good worst case: use DEC and JNZ to make jump chains -- can do any relative offset!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - No two-byte opcodes can be used because these are prefixed
   with 0x0F.
   - These mostly look like fancy stuff
   - There are opcodes for setting up the LDT and GDT, which
     I think are needed to get into unreal mode. (Would need
     to use self-modifying code, or some other trick?)
   - SSE, MMX, VMX are here; stuff like CMOV that's useful
     but inessential.
   - "Jump short" instructions
