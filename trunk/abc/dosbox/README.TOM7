This is an uninteresting fork of DOSBox that I used in the development
of ABC. Basically it's just so that I can keep a record of my local
modifications (debug printing) in version control. It's likely (?) that
you want the real DOSBox from their repository;

svn co svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/dosbox/code-0/dosbox/trunk dosbox


Either way, on Ubuntu, I compiled like this:

apt-get install automake
apt-get install libncurses-dev
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-debug
make


--enable-debug is critical for turning on the built-in debugger!
