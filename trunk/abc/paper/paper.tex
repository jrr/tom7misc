\section{Introduction}

% texticutable

% ``characters'' ``words'' and ``paragraphs'' and ``pages''

% Literate executable, knuth

% ``PISC'' = Printable Instruction Set Computer, etc.

It's a common experience that each time you program a solution to a
hard problem, you do it a different way, due to a lack of complete
satisfaction with the way you did it last time. True to form, the
ABC compiler exercises this technique *within the same compiler*,
using a different approach to represent each of the intermediate
languages.

Thank you for playing wing commander.

Another possibility is to include readable debug information (e.g.
frame layouts) in a separate section.

histogram of actual bytes used in code segment?

interesting bugs:
  DI <- [DI]

words contained in this paper

style points for:
- put relocations a little later after CS, so that we can mark
  with text the spot where they go.

opportunity for style points, like making your phone number into
a word:

 j ? X 4 ?   (4 can alternatively be $ or ,) 

 NEED TO FIX:
  - some kind of output other than \_putc

 TOP PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:
  - don't jump at end of every block
  - don't assume a block needs to be split just because it's 0x7e-0x20.
    measure from the last jump!

dosbox patches, wing commander

The CISC Ridiculous

ascii art in paper

awesome text art headings?

Truly self-documenting
For good reasons that I will explain later...

I was kidding when I said the x86 architecture is elegant.

Dr. Dobbs Journal typing in the program

ES segment must be used for IN?

TODO: X86 vs x86

(Idea: ladder is actually interspersed in code, by putting some long instruction
byte (that takes several arguments) before DEC SP JNZ +7e? We can jump directly
to the jump, but if executed in a normal synchronized flow, then it executes some
instruction that does nothing (load immediate?).)

(Idea: Once we've gone past EIP=0xFFFF, we can still execute code from our binary.
It may be possible to get back to CS by doing a jump with the address/operand size prefix?
Neither one has an effect in DOSBox, which may be a bug? Anyway, if an interrupt
is triggered while we're up here, it seems like it only does a 16-bit RET, so that's
kinda busted.)

In video: show error in intel manual http:\\www.intel.com

``fractal geometry'')

XXX: Should really write about PSP.
could write about optimizing the value table

Ideas for improvement before paper's submitted:
 - Implement 'void' return type
 - Make int literals actually 16 bit for now?
 - Implement multiplication and division
 - Implement switch
 - in paper.c, support multichannel sound.
 - implement sbrk primitive (just returns 0x8000?)
