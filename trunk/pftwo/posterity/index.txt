stuck-rock-manual-objectives-contra
 - Two player, manual cheater objectives. Eventually makes it to waterfall
   level, playing pretty well if slow. Can't make this jump which you have
   to time to avoid a falling rock and also go over a pit. This was right
   before I tried adding player location detection and random goals.

contra-firstgoals-fastforward
 - Starts with 7700 frames of the training data (gets to the "3d" section).
 - This was my first time running it with goals. They were randomly
   just chosen as inputs, and part of the twoplayer worker state.
   0.999 * objective_score + 0.001 * distance_to_goal_score.
 - It's bad. There are only a few goals in the output movie and each kept
   for just a few hundred frames (well, I guess a few seconds is usually
   enough to reach a goal). It doesn't even look like it ever tries to
   go to the goal.

stuck-rocks-deathpenalty
 - Explicit penalty for death. Still has the "goals" thing but I think
   it doesn't do anything. Verified that the tree's scores are very
   flat when it's stuck; I think this is a good heuristic to inform
   when it's wise to explore vs. ascend.

contra.waterfall-explore-1260000
 - First overnight with explicit goals when we get stuck.
 - Fastforward to waterfall
 - Makes it farther than ever on waterfall, but gets into loops killing
   dudes. I guess there's not enough incentive to explore, or it doesn't
   spend enough time playing from explore spots to see how to get further
   in the level (this level is pretty hard!)
 - I think it might be getting points until it gets an extra life, and
   then dying on purpose (because you warp to the top of the screen)!
 - 1.3B frames!

contra.3Bframes.flatobjective
 - Here, just using the level+screen as an objective. (Plus death
   avoidance.) Warmup only. Ran for several days.
 - Get stuck on the boss battle at the end of level 2. Probably
   just takes too long with random play before there's any improvement
   to objective. (It does at least destroy some of the stuff in
   its exploration, but the final movie just doesn't commit to any
   of it.)
 - The final movie is only 16k frames (pretty efficiently play)
   despite running so very long.
 - In this one, the goals seem to be doing something on the first
   level at least.
 - This version had an issue where all the new nodes had equal objective
   score, so the tree wasn't being pruned -- 1.5 million frames in there,
   which did gunk up the works.

contra.nes.firebridge-flat
 - Just like the previous but fixed a bug where ties weren't being broken
   in pruning. Also improved the performance of tree cleanup.
 - I think this is the furthest I ever made it on a complete playthrough?
 - Only took 1.3B frames to make significant progress up the waterfall.
   Gets to that fire bridge, with one deliberate death (31 -> 30 lives).
   The waterfall level is still very hard, but it seems like this strategy
   would eventually ascend it.
 - On the waterfall level, it seems to get unstuck best when the players
   are near one another.
 - There still seems to be some right-side bias, presumably due to markov.
 - Had the most trouble on the boss at the end of level 2, which makes
   sense since there's no gradient to follow. Pruning the tree seems to
   result in eventual progress though. (Why?) Not sure how exploration
   would help here, except that if you're under the boss you're more
   likely to hit it with bullets. Another kind of exploration, like
   screen contents exploration (graphics), would probably be needed.
   Score gradient would help in practice.
