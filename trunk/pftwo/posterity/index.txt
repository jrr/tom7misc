stuck-rock-manual-objectives-contra
 - Two player, manual cheater objectives. Eventually makes it to waterfall
   level, playing pretty well if slow. Can't make this jump which you have
   to time to avoid a falling rock and also go over a pit. This was right
   before I tried adding player location detection and random goals.

contra-firstgoals-fastforward
 - Starts with 7700 frames of the training data (gets to the "3d" section).
 - This was my first time running it with goals. They were randomly
   just chosen as inputs, and part of the twoplayer worker state.
   0.999 * objective_score + 0.001 * distance_to_goal_score.
 - It's bad. There are only a few goals in the output movie and each kept
   for just a few hundred frames (well, I guess a few seconds is usually
   enough to reach a goal). It doesn't even look like it ever tries to
   go to the goal.

stuck-rocks-deathpenalty
 - Explicit penalty for death. Still has the "goals" thing but I think
   it doesn't do anything. Verified that the tree's scores are very
   flat when it's stuck; I think this is a good heuristic to inform
   when it's wise to explore vs. ascend.

contra.waterfall-explore-1260000
 - First overnight with explicit goals when we get stuck.
 - Fastforward to waterfall
 - Makes it farther than ever on waterfall, but gets into loops killing
   dudes. I guess there's not enough incentive to explore, or it doesn't
   spend enough time playing from explore spots to see how to get further
   in the level (this level is pretty hard!)
 - I think it might be getting points until it gets an extra life, and
   then dying on purpose (because you warp to the top of the screen)!
 - 1.3B frames!

contra.3Bframes.flatobjective
 - Here, just using the level+screen as an objective. (Plus death
   avoidance.) Warmup only. Ran for several days.
 - Get stuck on the boss battle at the end of level 2. Probably
   just takes too long with random play before there's any improvement
   to objective. (It does at least destroy some of the stuff in
   its exploration, but the final movie just doesn't commit to any
   of it.)
 - The final movie is only 16k frames (pretty efficiently play)
   despite running so very long.
 - In this one, the goals seem to be doing something on the first
   level at least.
 - This version had an issue where all the new nodes had equal objective
   score, so the tree wasn't being pruned -- 1.5 million frames in there,
   which did gunk up the works.

contra.nes.firebridge-flat
 - Just like the previous but fixed a bug where ties weren't being broken
   in pruning. Also improved the performance of tree cleanup.
 - I think this is the furthest I ever made it on a complete playthrough?
 - Only took 1.3B frames to make significant progress up the waterfall.
   Gets to that fire bridge, with one deliberate death (31 -> 30 lives).
   The waterfall level is still very hard, but it seems like this strategy
   would eventually ascend it.
 - On the waterfall level, it seems to get unstuck best when the players
   are near one another.
 - There still seems to be some right-side bias, presumably due to markov.
 - Had the most trouble on the boss at the end of level 2, which makes
   sense since there's no gradient to follow. Pruning the tree seems to
   result in eventual progress though. (Why?) Not sure how exploration
   would help here, except that if you're under the boss you're more
   likely to hit it with bullets. Another kind of exploration, like
   screen contents exploration (graphics), would probably be needed.
   Score gradient would help in practice.

(started using AOT-compiled contra.nes at this point I think)

contra.nes.waterfallboss-2900000
 - First experiment with grid. Based on how sparse the grid seems, it's
   not clear that it's really helping (although it does keep these nodes
   alive, so that's something), but nonetheless this is the farthest
   it's ever gotten: All the way to the boss at the top of the waterfall!
 - This version of the grid requires the two players to be in the same
   cell (or else it's ineligible). This does not seem to happen often
   by random chance, which is a bit weird since the explicit goals try
   to put the players at the same location.
 - On some of the tight jumps in the waterfall, the players were clearly
   starting from the same position, which is a good hint that either goals
   or grid is doing *something*.
 - This was just the flat objective function of level/screen (no screen
   coordinate). It probably gets stuck on the waterfall boss for the
   same reason as in the previous experiment.
 - I didn't actually watch this whole movie, so there may be some good
   stuff in the second half of the waterfall?


contra.nes-waterfallboss2-3860000
 - Improved the grid code so that we judge against the best current
   node in the heap, not 1.0 (which might be and impossible glimpse
   of the future because of deaths).
 - Got to waterfall boss by 1.3B frames, which I think is faster than
   before. Significant 'green' coveage of grid while it's stuck, which
   seems working as intended.
 - Score is going up a little? So is depth? Depth ~429000.
   Might have killed one of the arms. Score is changing a little.
 - Still gets stuck on waterfall boss though. Like 4B frames.


next:
 - Tried generating moves using the goal. Very generic; believes that
   you press "up" to go up, for example. (But there's a bug hehe)
 - Objectives include pixel position and score
 - got to L2 boss by 319M frames
 - first floating waterfall platform <593M
 - To ice platforms by 1.6B! Depth is 248000. It's possible that this
   was just luck? 
 - Whoa even the ice spike car
     .. these may be hard because you need to kill them quick
 - I think the input assignment when going to a goal might be backwards??
     - you can see this a lot on the first level; when there's a goal
       active they like to hug the left edge of the screen. And then
       there's a goal with x=43 at the end and they run right
     - if for some reason it works better with this fixed, then
       we should try just generating very 'dynamic' move sequences
       during exploration (like 'hold right') irrespective of what the
       goal is. I guess it would not be a hard problem to try to learn
       buttons/button combinations that change the player's coordinates
       in any given position
 - Waterfall has some nice points dodging rocks, but also a substantial
   amount of hiding on the RHS.
 - gets past that damn rock at around 72,000 frames. Seems most likely
   to get stuck on RHS when there is an endless stream of guys to kill,
   slightly bumping the score.
 - Being stuck trying to climb at about 90k frames is silly, because this
   jump isn't that tight. can't they just both plan a trip to that ledge
   on the left, then luck into jumping right? I think explicitly planning
   to get to adjacent grid cells would help here.
     - aha they finally win by farming an extra life,
       setting a goal over there, and then red kills himself
 - Another stuck one at a moving platform, ~120k. Goal helps it go left,
   then blue suicides
 - Around 124k, blue makes it up the moving platform, but then comes
   BACK DOWN so that he can be with red. Then they clearly move in tandem
   to get up the narrow platforms, which is good
 - All in all, it's obvious that goals are really helping avoid stuckness
   in this movie.
 - waterfall boss at 156M. It may just be because we have spread gun,
   and red seems to die at the very end, so this could have been a very
   lucky victory. But at least we're close on this part, perhaps even
   with prior settings
 - 3d corridor is fine, with some slow rooms. They still love the right
   side of the screen. Some trouble when they need to duck on the
   left. It does seem to help that it picks a goal where it
   erroneously moves left (easy to fix) but then holds down (because
   it thinks it needs to go up -- there are lots more 'up' goals than
   'down' goals because the player is always near the bottom of the
   screen alas)
 - regular tree search is sometimes backing up all the way to the
   waterfall climb -- this seems nuts. We may be able to improve efficiency
   but limiting the score loss in FindGoodNode or whatever.
 - red has weird sack at the beginning of this boss, but then seems to
   immediately get an extra life (maybe they cancel out?). Long fight;
   there are lots of dudes to kill for points but no incentive to
   shoot at the weak points, especially since you can kill dudes from
   its favorite spot at rhs
 - beats at 237k
 - ice level is pretty easy for it; this particular movie ends right
   before the spike car
 - there are two spike cars in this level. they might be pretty hard
   (without taking a death) because you have to shoot them
   continuously, and fast, or else they run you over.
 - it made it past the spike cars! To the alien by 2.3B frames
   depth is 253k
 - < 3.79B to beat alien and get to fire beam level!!
   depth is 262k
