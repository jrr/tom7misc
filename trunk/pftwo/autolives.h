// Like autocamera, but for finding memory locations to protect
// the values of, like a location that stores the number of
// lives the player has. (This could also be stuff like player
// health.)
//
// This first cut is based on the following idea.
//   - On most frames, it does not change.
//   - A value containing lives should often be at risk of
//     decrementing (i.e., random play does decrement it on
//     "many" frames).
//   - When the value is decremented to zero (or below zero),
//     the player loses control "a lot more" than if the value
//     is 1 or more.
//
// Since training data probably doesn't contain a lot of deaths,
// we need to also search inputs to find examples.

// Ideas TODO:
//  - Can filter out memory locations that are write-before-read
//    (i.e, temporaries)
