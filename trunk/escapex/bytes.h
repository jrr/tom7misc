// For portability, we avoid assuming any endianness in escape file
// formats, instead working only with byte vectors (usually stored in

// their way into cc-lib and elsewhere. They had really confusing
// names like "sizes", "shint", and "shout", which were based on
// weird puns.
//
// This is a header-only replacement so that the level and solution
// code (which includes reading/writing the serialized format) can be
// independent from ./util.cc, which causes some problems for
// embedding these in the server module (some symbols clash with
// cc-lib's utils).
