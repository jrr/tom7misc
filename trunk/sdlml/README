SDLML            Tom 7               8 Apr 2017

This is a set of wrappers (and utilities) for using the Simple
Directmedia Layer (SDL) in Standard ML (SML). It's a bit of a pain
to get it working, and the only part I actively maintain is the
main library (sdl-sig.sml).


There have been several contributors:

   Dr. Tom Murphy VII, Ph.D., CEO
   Rob Arnold (SDL mixer basics)
   Bill Kendrick (PNG saving code, via Tux Paint)
   Ruy Ley-Wild (SML port of my C++ Bresenham's algorithm implementation)
   Adam Goode (Patches to my C++ SDL utilities, some of which made it here)
