  (* Coarse pixel-based collision for an edge of a rectangular
     body moving in its normal direction.

     Consider the bottom edge of this body:

        +-+-+-+-+-+
        | | | | | |
        +-+-+-+-+-+
        | | | | | |
        +-+-+-+-+-+
        | | | | | |
        +-+-+-+-+-+

     The body is assumed to be non-colliding (i.e., all its
     pixels are empty) before the call.* We move the body down
     one coarse pixel (because this may change the locus) and
     then ask whether any pixel in the bottom row is occupied.

     If no pixels are occupied, then the body can move freely
     along this axis and the result is Air.

     If more than one pixel is occupied, or there is a single
     occupied pixel but it's not in the corner, then the
     result is Blocked.

     To enable motion along angled surfaces, we also allow the
     body to be ejected up to one pixel. This happens when
     exactly one corner pixel is occupied (recall that we are
     only testing the bottom edge, so this is really to say
     that one of the edge's endpoints is occupied):

        +-+-+-+-+-+
       #| | | | | |
        +-+-+-+-+-+
       #| | | | | |
        +-+-+-+-+-+
       #|#| | | | |
        +-+-+-+-+-+
       # #   v

       # #

     In this case, ejection is possible if moving the body to
     the right one pixel leaves the (entire) right edge unblocked.
     We test this by recursively invoking getcontact on the right
     edge. In this recursive invocation we don't allow ejection,
     in order to prevent loops.
       - If the right edge is completely clear, then the result
         is Eject.
       - If the right edge has any pixels, then the result is
         Blocked. Both the corner pixel (in the y+1 configuration)
         and right pixel(s) (in the x+1,y+1 configuration) are
         implicated.

     (XXX to dynamics part:
      In the ejection case, it probably should affect velocity;
      consider the case when jumping up a very shallow upward
      slope, where you happen to land your right foot on a pixel
      and get ejected left.)

     * Note that in the recursive call for ejection, there IS
       GUARANTEED to be an occupied pixel, violating its own
       assumption?

     Note that using this edge contact method can allow a body
     (that moves the locus) to enter a previously-free space
     (say, with its feet) that causes some object to overlap
     its head. TODO: Not sure what to do about this (might not
     be a problem?)
