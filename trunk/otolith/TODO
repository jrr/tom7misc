 - delete a node from objects tesselation.
 - check that deleting nodes keeps a tesselation in a good state.
 - reimplement keyed tesselation check()
 - put tesselation triangles in canonical order?
 - history to rendering, so that when an object just pops into
   existence we can animate that; vectors for moving nodes too.
   Important to get this flexibility right early.
