(* A tesselation is a collection of non-overlapping triangles. Each
   vertex can have multiple coordinates, one for each "key" (functor
   argument).

   We use this data structure to implement both the "areas" and
   "objects".

   Each screen has a single "areas" tesselation that covers the play
   area. It defines the gradients along which the objects move.
   Gradients are given with barycentric interpolation between each
   triangle's vertices. The areas are static, so there is just one
   set of coordinates. The key is just (), and some of the generality
   of this functor becomes degenerate and a little confusing.

   A screen can have many objects; these are the solids that the
   player sees and interacts with. An object's vertices have multiple
   coordinates; they are keyed to the vertices of the areas
   tesselation. This allows the object's shape/location to be
   parameterized.

   This code doesn't compute the interpolations; it simply stores
   the tesselations as a data structure and provides some functionality
   for editing it. Screen instantiates the functor twice to create
   the areas and objects, and understands how they interact. *)

     each of those triangles is split by making a new edge from the
     created split point to the one node that is not on the edge.

     Only succeeds if this point is not one of the edge's vertices,
     and if no degenerate triangles will result. Additionally, the
     same split must work (and produce no degenerate triangles) in all
     configurations for the keyedtesselation. Your best bet is to do
     all the splitting for the tesselation with a single configuration
     before creating others. *)

  (* When using the given key, find the closest internal edge to the
     given point which can be flipped. Flipping is possible only for
     internal edges, which are shared by two triangles. Flipping
     changes the edge to be between the unconnected nodes as shown,
     resulting in two different triangles. This is allowed:

          n1                           n1
           .---. n3                     .---. n3
           |\  |                        |  /|

        n4 |__\|                     n4 |/__|
               n2                           n2

     But for example not this one:

                    n3
                   .
                 ,`/
               ,` /
             ,`  /

            \  |
             \ |
              \|
              n4

     since a new edge from n3 to n4 would leave us with two overlapping
     triangles (or if n3 and n4 are colinear, a degenerate triangle).

     When it can succeed, returned are the original edge, the point on
     it that's closest to the input point, and the potential new edge.
     No changes are made. This is the same edge used by flipedge
     below, when it can succeed. *)

     key function looks up the node ID in a map of already-deserialized
     nodes to find it.

     Since toworld is allowed to renumber nodes, it returns a mapping
