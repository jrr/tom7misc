For space game

saturday morning:
 - inventory graphics
 - full spaceship sketch
 - mouse inputs
 - "person" object (inc. player, robots)
 - click to walk to point
 - draw one human

saturday
 - game basically working
 - start to finish playable?
 - are all music channels playing?
 - inventory management: When I try to pick something up,
   how do I show that there's no space for it?
      - one solution is that "GET" automatically opens
        the inventory and makes your cursor that object?
      - need to think the mechanics through here.

assets
 - player character
 - title screen music
     - [FINISH]
 - main game atmospheric music
 - grate guy
   - grate guy death anim
 - airlock guy
   - airlock guy death
 - guy uselessly shooting you
 - captai lady
 - ovopositor
 - self-destruct
 - end / credits
 - frown face (for like rejecting action)

must have
 - name for game
 - come up with efficient art "look"
 - title screen with name on it
 - way to define walkable area
 - click to walk to spot
 - inventory can open/close
 - some way to limit dropping inventory?
 - draw split-level
 - script autonomous / asynchronous npc actions
 - color font (for mouseover effect)
 - incorporate "normal" (dissonant) title theme (at end?)

nice
 - animate egg
 - intro scene, warping to ship
 - (MUTE) state instead of SILENCED
 - slow parallax stars for background always
 - title theme could be improved
 - slow down title theme a little
 - make it work with touch events 

polish
 - font colors
 - font emphasis (vibrating letters)
 - scanline animation for inventory icon / actual
 - clean up and shade main character arms
 - fix click sound in title theme
 - lowercase space font?

ideas / notes:
 - maybe you start with a bunch of eggs in inventory, and this
   gates your progress, because you refuse to put them down
   except by ovopositing them in a dead body?

how many humans? 4 eggs in inventory would fit, but no more (if 2x2)
could also be non-human enemies (e.g. cyborg crewmate)
 - grate guy
 - airlock guy (but doesn't the body get sucked out into space?)
 - guy uselessly shooting
 - captain lady
 
this is probably the minimum that would work, so let's go for it.
can always add non-humans.

For each death, you should have to solve an inventory-packing puzzle.

- maybe it's impossible to drop things? this would allow the puzzles
  to get harder over time
