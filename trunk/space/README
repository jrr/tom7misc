When I make games for competitions like Ludum Dare, I like to just
copy a recent game, rip out its guts, and work from there. I'll often
make improvements to the core code that can be reused later, but
I'll also often make shortcut 11th-hour hacks that are gross even
in the game, let alone a shared codebase. The idea of this directory
is to maintain a very simple example game that I can use as a starting
point for others, and a target for merging good stuff back into when
a fork wraps up.

What's here today is a fork of "Connector World", which was my last
html5 compo game that had music and animation.

Currently, you need to run a webserver (mongoose is a fine choice)
because it wants to be able to fetch files from a server (and browsers
will not let javascript open local files this way).
