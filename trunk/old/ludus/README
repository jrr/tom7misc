Ludus was the project I poured more time and dream power into than any 
other without ever completing. The idea was to make a 2D tile-based RPG 
system to make games like Final Fantasy III and Chrono Trigger (popular 
at the time and still one of my favorite genres).

In the end, I drew a load of tiles, brainstormed a lot, and wrote a
pretty sophisticated map editor with its own scripting language. But
no game engine and no game. A hard-drive crash where I lost a
significant amount of work ultimately made me abandon the project.


Most of this was written to use the excellent Allegro graphics library
under DJGPP (DOS).
