Think about script opcodes for beasts/items/weapons/special attacks.

Start writing compiler

Write debugger, maybe

do that cliff and mountain landscape with tiles

Work on functs.txt.

Add "global variables". These are variables like the players names, etc.
They should be declared in the "WORLD" object, and then modified at will
by the other objects.

parsestatementblock ()  in the basic program will recursively parse a
statement block; either:

saymsg ("Hello");

or

{
saymsg ("Hello");
if (x) {
  poop_on_car;
  }
}

In the second case, it would call another parsestatementblock for the if
statement. I *THINK* I can get it to work this way.
