For moving between maps.

portal (
     string DESTMAPNAME,
     string START_GLYPH,
     int WIDTH,
     int x_start,
     int y_start
       )

would load up map DESTMAPNAME at (x_start,y_start) if the player is aligned
within WIDTH tiles to the right of the object (or on the object itself)
appears as START_GLYPH.

Going between two maps, it should check if it is the same MIDI file, and
then not stop and restart it if so.

For defining objects in the maps (and other objects) with nice names

We have an equivalency file, which lists the object raw name (filename) and
their Nice Sounding Equivalent

PORTAL Portal
CENTPD01 Centipede1
SHRUB Shrub
KROBE01 KingRobe

et cetera.

I guess.
