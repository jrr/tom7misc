LITHP - "Ludus: It's The Happy Program!"                  Revision 1

Description: Documentation on the syntax of the object scripting language,
LITHP. Final version.

###### #### General:

Despite Lithp's nomenclatorial parody of Lisp, syntax is intended to mostly
resemble C.

As in C, whitespace is ignored, except for inside // type comments
and inside string literals.

Lithp is NOT case-sensitive.

All variables are global.

###### #### Data types:

There are but 2 data types: STRING and INT.

Indeed, STRING is actually a pointer stored the same way as an INT, and
the assembler will not complain at all if you try to interchange them
(except when the program runs and crashes itself).

An INT is a signed word (Two bytes). The range is -32767 to 32767.

###### #### Remarks:

The remarks are the same as canonical C:

/*   for multiline
     block quoting
                    */

// For single-line quotes and comments

In inline assembler mode, you may also comment with REM. In most
situations, extra characters on a line will be ignored, so

COPY C 5336      ' copy iterations into reg C

will parse fine (but the syntax is not especially recommended).
