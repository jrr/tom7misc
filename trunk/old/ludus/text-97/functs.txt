cache_bitmap (string Bitmapname)

This function loads a bitmap by name from the pak file and stores it in
memory so that it can be displayed later on.

cache_sound (string Soundname)

Ditto.

disp_bitmap (string Bitmapname, int x, int y)

Displays a bitmap on the screen. Not meant to be used very often --
generally only for introductions and Cinematic Cutscenes.

fade_bitmap (string Bitmapname, int x, int y, [-1,1] direction,
             int basecolor, int speed, [0,1] background)

Fades a bitmap in or out, like disp_bitmap.

Direction: 1 is for basecolor to bitmap, -1 is for bitmap to basecolor.
Basecolor: I have the feeling this will be limited... but it should be
the background color which we are fading from. 0 to fade from the
underlying bitmap.
Speed: The speed to fade in/out at.
Background: Make the fading a background task, if set to 1. Otherwise,
don't continue script operation until it is finished.

play_sound (string Soundname, int volume, int pan)

Should be pretty self-evident.

sleep (int milliseconds)

Pause script execution for milliseconds milliseconds. Since we don't have
floating-point variables, we want this extra precision (though it is unlikely
that the engine will be able to correctly time say, 2 milliseconds.)

slumber (int seconds)

Pause script execution for seconds seconds. Intended for waits longer than
32 or 64 seconds, if that is a limitation of sleep.
