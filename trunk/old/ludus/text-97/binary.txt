The Binary Code Format                            revision 5
                                                  22 July

22 June: Got rid of 32-bit data. Nobody needs crap that big.
22 July: Fixed an error.

This is the actual format used for the binary code of the compiled objects.

CODE   MNEMONIC

00      STOP

Arguments: None

Stops execution of the object and lets it wait for more events to activate
it again.

01      LOCK

Arguments: None

Sets the object's Locked flag so that other methods cannot be activated
until an UNLOCK opcode.

02      UNLOCK

Arguments: None

Unlocks an object by clearing its Locked bit. See LOCK.

03      JUMP                       Absolute Jump

Arguments: WORD address

Performs an Absolute Jump locally within the object's code. ie, JUMP 03AH
would jump to the 03AHth byte in the code.

04      RJUMP                      Relative Jump

Arguments: signed WORD distance

Jumps relative to the current instruction. RJUMP 0000 would make an
infinite loop (until another method broke it, if it was unLOCKed),
RJUMP FFFE would jump 2 bytes before it.

05      COPY                       Copy Source to Destination

Arguments: 3-Byte Destination (See Table 1), 3-Byte Source 

COPY 02 20 00 00 03 21 00 00 would copy the contents of memory at 0321h
(locally) into the OUTARG1 register.

06      FUNCTION                   Call a program function

Arguments: WORD (local) Pointer to text of function name
Arguments to function in OUTARG{1...10}.

This is a way of calling functions in the engine which aren't explicitly
present in byte-code. The engine had better know what the hell function
you are talking about.

07      INC                        Increment Register / Memory Location

Arguments: 3-Byte Value (Table 1)

Adds 1 to the memory location or register.

08      DEC                        Decrement

Arguments: 3-Byte Value (Table 1)

09      ADD                        Add

Arguments: 3-Byte Destination, 3-byte source

Adds source to Destination.

0A      SUB                        Subtract

Arguments: 3B Dest, 3B src

0B      MUL                        Multiply

Arguments: 3B Dest, 3B src

Multiply Dest * src and store the result in Dest.
Had better not overflow. (Though max width is in fact DWORD)

0C      DIV                        Integer Divide

Arguments: 3B Dest, 3B src

Divide (dest/src) and store the result in Dest.

0D      CMP                        Compare

Arguments: 3B, 3B

Compares the two arguments and stores the result in register R.

Register R's values:

00  ARG1 == ARG2
01  ARG1 >  ARG2
02  ARG1 <  ARG2

0E      JL                         Jump-if-less-than

Arguments: Word address

If R contains 02 (ARG1 < ARG2), then jump to the address, otherwise just
continue.

We also have the following similar opcodes:
     
0F      JLE                        Jump-if-less-than-or-equal
10      JG                         Jump-if-greater
11      JGE                        Jump-if-greater-or-equal
12      JE                         Jump-if-equal
13      JNE                        Jump-if-inequal

14      SEND                       Send method to other object

Arguments: Word (local) pointer to string with object name, similar pointer
to method name to Send.
Arguments to the method in OUTARG{1...10}.

For when the program does a "signpost.die".

This will evoke the "die" event in all unLOCKed signpost objects.

15      RAND                       Random

Arguments: 3-byte Destination, word lowerbound, word upperbound

Generates a random number between lowerbound and upperbound (inclusive)
and stores it in the Destination.

16      HCF                        Halt and Catch Fire

Arguments: 1-byte exit code

Crash the engine with an error message.

17      CALL                       Call

Arguments: WORD local address

ùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄùÄù

ÄÄÄÄÄÄ     Table 1 - 3-Byte data:   ÄÄÄÄÄÄ  

First Byte:

00 - Raw data. Next two bytes are the raw data. (WORD)

01 - Memory location (local). Next two bytes are the WORD address.

02 - Memory location pointed to by the contents of a register. See register
table.

03 - A "register". See register table (Table 3).

ÄÄÄÄÄÄ     Table 3 - Registers:    ÄÄÄÄÄÄ  

First byte: (note, hexadecimal!)

00 - 'A' register
01 - 'B'
02 - 'C'
03 - 'D'
04 - 'R' (result of compare)
10 - INARG1 register (the ten registers filled when the program is called)
11 - INARG2
...
19 - INARG10
20 - OUTARG1 register (ten basic arg registers, for calling functions)
21 - OUTARG2
...
29 - OUTARG10

Second byte is always zero.
