Questions:


1. How do we let a treasure chest save state, and remember that it has
already been opened?

I was thinking of a setState() function, like:

if (getState(my_id) == 0) {
   msgBox("I laugh at you! (But only once)");
   setState(my_id,1);
   }

Then we could save this State space with the savegame.

You see?

But how do we assign each object their own ID?

TM7 (8.11): I think this is good. I still don't know about the IDs. I say,
they get a word (16 toggleable bits or 65535 different states) of state
space. Anything over that will have to be declared as a global variable
in the WORLD.LOB.
