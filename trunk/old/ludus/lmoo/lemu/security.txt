Security concerns to eventually address

give lob class a pointer to a string near the end of the object which is not
terminated. I padded with a null by default but this allows them (because
it changes the length to originallength+1) to change this byte to nonnul.
Suggest changing .length() calls to something which returns length-1.

-- actually, not an issue. the implementation of the string class guarantees
that there is a null terminating the c_str() representation.
