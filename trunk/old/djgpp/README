This is old code, from many years ago, when I was first learning that
there was more to programming than BASIC games, and had all sorts of
crazy ideas in my head. I'm sure there are some gems here, but mostly
it is pretty embarassing. Think of it like a museum.

Note that some of this stuff got duplicated (lmoo, tp = tompaint) into 
the parent directory and elsewhere. I am not sure of the lineage, but 
this directory is probably the oldest.
