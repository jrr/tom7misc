             crypt                  26 June 2017

When I was a freshman in college I read "Applied Cryptography" from 
cover to cover, and was entranced by the topic. Like all things I get 
entranced with, I wanted to make my own. So in this directory are some 
pretty naive designs for cryptographic algorithms. Some are totally 
stupid (ecrypt), some might have some kernel of an idea (inline-bridge), 
but for god's sake don't use these! There's a home page with some 
graphics and stuff:
