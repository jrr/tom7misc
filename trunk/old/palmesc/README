Over vacation one year I took a stab at porting my Quickbasic puzzle
game Escape to the palm pilot. I wish I had finished it, since it was
a good game and would have been perfect for the palm platform. I think
I got turned off by the bizarre "database" filesystem, but anyway,
what's here actually works pretty well and lets you push around blocks
and everything. I also even managed to port Escape's tileset to 8x8
monochrome for the palm!!

Code and graphics in the GPL.


Note: I new have a port of Escape to modern platforms using the SDL.
This doesn't include the Palm, but it may interest you anyway:
