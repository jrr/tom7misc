This is a fairly good ricochet robot solver. It finds solutions for
almost any board that's possible in just a few seconds, and improves
upon that solution continuously. One of the key features of this program
is that it finds simpler solutions earlier, and complex (but perhaps
shorter) ones later. Simplicity in this case is the number of times
you need to switch robots.

This program is based on a ricochet robot solver ("ricochet.c") that
was placed in the public domain by its author, Alan deLespinasse. You
