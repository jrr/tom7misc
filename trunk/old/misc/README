These are very small project (typically a single file) that don't even
deserve their own repositories in the tom7misc project.



latex-slides-makefile            Makefile for creating PDF slides with LaTeX 
			         that don't come out upside-down. Very 
				 tricky, despite what you might expect.

neural.sml                       A fairly unsophisticated neural net evaluator
                                 and learner written in SML.

shopping.ses                     Shopping list spreadsheet for use with 
	                         SES mode for emacs. It just adds up columns 
			         of quantity times price and displays 
	                         everything nicely.

mixtape.ses                      SES spreadsheet for making mix tapes or other
                                 compilations.

squares8.c                       Search, by brute force, for a solution to
                                 the 8x8 "no squares" problem. (Place as many
                                 stones as possible on an 8x8 grid without
                                 making a square at any orientation.)

output-freeness.elf              Short Twelf example of output freeness checking.

dataflow/                        Dataflow networks (prime sieve) in C/C++.

dmg/                             A well-intentioned but poorly executed
                                 attempt at computer-generated dance music
                                 in C++. Can generate MIDIs, but never got
                                 much further than that.

clearhist                        When in your path, . `which clearhist` will clear
                                 the current command history in bash. (Suggestions
                                 for easier ways are appreciated!)

infix-bug.sml                    Test for a really picky and really common parsing
                                 bug in Standard ML.

rec.sml                          Shows recursive datatypes alone can lead to looping
                                 programs.

shortest-nonterm.sml             Shows how exceptions alone can lead to looping
                                 programs (via Lillibridge and Harper). Obfuscated
                                 to make it as short as possible.

awesome.sml                      Encodes the simply-typed lambda calculus in phantom
                                 types, using combinatory logic and explicit reductions.
                                 Not recommended to actually do this when programming.
