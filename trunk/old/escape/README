Note: I have ported Escape to modern operating systems using the SDL.
You can find the code for this new version here:

http://tom7misc.cvs.sourceforge.net/tom7misc/escapex/

You can download binaries or source archives from here:

http://escape.spacebar.org/

This new version is much more polished and fun to play, so this
version is only really relevant for historic purposes.

Escape is my favorite of my DOS games. It's a puzzle game inspired by
"Adventures of Lolo," "Chip's Challenge," etc. I wrote it in Quick
Basic, made (with help) over 100 levels for it, and released it as
shareware back in 1995 or so. When I left for college, I made it
"free" in the sense that you could download the registered version
without sending me money, and now I am making it "free" in the sense
that the source code is licensed under the GPL. You can consider the
legal stuff in the documentation as superseded by the file "COPYING."

Otherwise, read escape.txt for the game's documentation.


eula/  -  holds the "Escape User Level Archive," which is some of
          the levels that players sent me.

goodesc/  -  all the levels made by me and my friends that I included
             in the game. The shareware and registered campaigns are
             built of these.

escapex/  -  very bare beginnings of a windows (visual basic) version.
             basically just hi-res tiles.



Escape uses the public domain library "LoadGif", which you can get
from here:

It's included in CVS, but I may have modified it; I don't remember.
I think that in order to compile escape, you need to start QB with
special flags to load the LoadGif library. I don't remember that,
either.
