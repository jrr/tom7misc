 þ XCOMP version 1.3  -  Escape Campaign Compiler

     XCOMP is a utility for creating campaigns for the game Escape. These
campaigns can be used with the Shareware or Registered version of the game
(and there is nothing wrong with doing that at all), but the utility itself
is for the use of registered users only.

     A campaign, as you probably know, is a set of Escape levels which are
together in one file. Escape will keep track of your progress in a campaign,
and will reveal the "win message" after you beat all of the levels.

     XCOMP uses a script file to operate. The standard extension for these
is ".xsp". The structure of a script file is as follows:

%begin
%title The title of the Campaign
Levels {
LEVEL1
LEVEL2
LEVEL3 (etc. - up to 50 files)
}
winMSG {
The message for when you win. (10
lines long max, each line 40
characters or less)
}
%end

     You can look at and compile the included example script called
"example.xsp" to see how this works.

     Note: You must have a title, and everything must be in order. Blank
lines and whitespace in certain situations may cause the compile to fail.
In the example above, LEVEL1, LEVEL2, and LEVEL3 must be Escape levels
which you created with Escaped, they must be in the current directory, and
they must have the .ESC extension. When you've created your campaign script,
you compile it by typing:

XCOMP scriptfile

Where scriptfile is the name of your script. If all goes well, campaign
with the same name as your scriptfile (but the extension .XCP) will be
created. This campaign can be used in the same way that the campaigns
included with Escape are.

     Note: Campaign files cannot be decompiled. This means you should save
any .ESC files that you create, especially since you can't add to a pre-made
campaign; you need to compile it again from scratch (using the same script
file, if you like) with all of the original levels available.

     That's it! Have fun!
