Way after everyone had graduated to photoshop, I was still using an
old DOS drawing program called DeluxePaint II Enhanced. That program
was great. When I started trying to make my own games I decided that
it didn't cut the mustard, though, so one break I tried to clone it
again using the Allegro graphics library for DJGPP in DOS.

It was called, "TomPaint II Enchanted."

You can't save, so don't use it for anything important! But it is
probably a pretty good example of how to do some stuff with Allegro.

Code released in the GPL.
