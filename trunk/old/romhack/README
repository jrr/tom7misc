A collection of tools built while exploring Gameboy ROM hacking. Many
of these may be useful for other kinds of binary data, however.


translate/                         C++

      Performs a character-to-character translation on a file, as specified
      by a mapping. Use this to translate a ROM to the ASCII character set,
      for instance, in order to edit in emacs hexl-mode and then convert
      back with the inverse mapping.

tile/                              C++

      A filter to/from each of the following formats:
        binary: raw binary data.
        hex: hexadecimal bytes.
        gfx: gameboy packed graphics format, using the
             characters . + * # to stand for the four
             levels of grey.
             This allows ascii-editing of graphics within
             a ROM file (say, within emacs), and soon
             a path to/from the "merchandise" java tile
             editor.

pipe/                              C++

      Simulates the pipe (|) facility of many popular shells by
      creating temp files. This is needed to run translate with
      hexl-mode in emacs (see data/hexl-commands.el.example).

merchandise/                       Java 2

      Graphical tile editor. Accepts input from tile "gfx" format
      above. Written mostly by Don.

haxor/                             Standard ML

      Small program which lets you look for differences between
      files. You can use this to modify values in your save-games,
      for instance, with little information about the format of
      the save file. For instance, you can track positions in
      successive save-games which decrease as you use a certain
      item, and then set that location (and therefore, your count
      of that item) to some ridiculously high value. Works best
      with the SML/NJ interactive loop.
