greenliant eeprom,
GLS29EE010-70-4C-PHE
maybe this is the same as SST29EE010?
The data sheet is almost identical:
http://www.metatech.com.hk/datasheet/sst/standard_mem_pdf/304-29xE010-3-DS.pdf
and this eeprom is supported by the cheap programmer on amazon, which I bought.
(It does seem to work to program using the SST. At least I can read back what
I wrote. But it's a bit flakey.)

vishay 1k and 2k resistors, 1/3W, 1%, metal film


Probably makes sense to use a transistor array:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_array
Might be reasonable 8-transistor array:
https://www.digikey.com/products/en?mpart=ULN2803A&v=497
which is like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ULN2003A
but these seem to be designed for higher-power applications
Be careful: You probably need schottky transistors for
any switching applications at this speed.


useful IO expander (i2c <-> 16 I/O ports, which can run at 5.5V):

*but* it is too slow to use for PPU output.
You could use this for on-board EEPROM programming, though?


I got this 8-bit bus transciever:
https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/595-CD74FCT245E
It looks like it can take 3.3v in and write 5v out, which would be
perfect. Even if not, a transistor-based (or other) level shifter
would clearly work with it.
"FCT" logic family is cmos-based ttl-compatible logic, yay


I also got this hex level shifter:
https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Texas-Instruments/CD4504BE?qs=sGAEpiMZZMsty6Jaj0%252bBBmDx0n9pcbkk8BeHlEmrJRY%3d

just because it was cheap and I might find at some point that the
voltage divider sucks. (And actually this chip is cheaper than 12
resistors anyway!)


Also consider this 8-bit TTL register:
TI CY74FCT2574T
http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/sccs076/sccs076.pdf


Consider: This classic octal bus transciever: 74LS245 (or 54LS245)
http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74ls245.pdf 

It is 3.4v "typical" on the outside, but operating at 5V and accepting
5V inputs. Propagation delay is in the 8-12ns range (assuming output
enable is just turned on). So this could be used as a level shifter on
the inputs, right? My only concern is that it doesn't give a maximum
voltage for output-high, so it might not even be safe.
