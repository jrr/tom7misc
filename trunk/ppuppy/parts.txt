greenliant eeprom,
GLS29EE010-70-4C-PHE
maybe this is the same as SST29EE010?
The data sheet is almost identical:
http://www.metatech.com.hk/datasheet/sst/standard_mem_pdf/304-29xE010-3-DS.pdf
and this eeprom is supported by the cheap programmer on amazon, which I bought.

vishay 1k and 2k resistors, 1/3W, 1%, metal film


Probably makes sense to use a transistor array:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_array
Might be reasonable 8-transistor array:
https://www.digikey.com/products/en?mpart=ULN2803A&v=497
which is like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ULN2003A
but these seem to be designed for higher-power applications


useful IO expander (i2c <-> 16 I/O ports, which can run at 5.5V):

*but* it is too slow to use for PPU output.
You could use this for on-board EEPROM programming, though?
