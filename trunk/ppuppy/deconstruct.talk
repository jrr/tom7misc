# (Another thing I like is when there's a lot
# of technical effort that goes into making the joke.)

# I know what you're thinking. There's a simple
# formula to this. Take something nostalgic and
# throw some modern software at it. Do it wrong.
# Humor.

# But this time it's a little different. And I
# only mean a little. For example you can see
# that my screen is blinking in an annoying way,
# something I would not normally tolerate.
# Actually I barely got this project working.
# The whole time I had a back-up plan, which was
# instead to do a talk like this,
#   JOKE SCHEMAS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE


# and I don't mean like DTD even though that is
# indeed a joke.

# I mean like, what do good "CS jokes"
# look like? It's a good talk idea because you
# don't have to actually do any of the jokes, just
# hyperanalyze them. You can make up some new
# categories of joke and nobody can say you're wrong
# because jokes are just like, your opinion man,
# and plus I can recycle old material, like those
# lazy episode of MacGyver that consisted 90% of
# flashbacks.

#  [ ] 
#      what is funny?

# Of course many other pretentious people have desiccated
# humor into prune dust by studying it. I couldn't find
# an attribution for this one, but it stuck with me; a
# definition of humor: 
# "A movie of a man eating a boot with a look of disgust on
# his face.  That's not funny."

slide
  images/boot-disgusted.png

# "But a man eating a boot, with a normal expression on
# his face.  That's funny!"
slide
  images/boot-neutral.png

# ?? IS IT? Well I think it's at least meta-funny that in the
# old days, eating a boot could be considered funny. But of
# course the point, which I agree with, is that humor is
# about defying expectations.

# Let's consider another NOT FUNNY / FUNNY pair.

# How the PPU works

slide

# So this allows us to put together a whole
# screen, like so:
slide
  images/mario-bw-grid.png
# So far it's just a single color.
# (Actually note mario is in color, and also
# not aligned to the grid. This is because he's
# actually a sprite. There are a million other
# topics like this, which we won't discuss.)
slide

# To add color to the scene...

# To connect this back to what we saw before,
