This is software, content, and hardware schematics for my project
called "PPUppy," which I used to give a few talks in 2018 and a
Youtube video called something like "Reverse emulating the NES to
give it SUPER POWERS!" (also, a long "Making Of" exegesis).

There's a hodgepodge of different licenses in here.

In images/ there are some items for which I don't own the copyright,
but which I believe are covered by fair use. (In particular, the
size of the excerpt is very small):

  - A few sprites and screenshots from NES games (Super Mario Bros.,
    Metroid, Legend of Zelda)
  - 26 frames from "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley; heavily
    down-sampled
  - An excerpt from the cover of the complete Season 3 DVD of "Charles
    in Charge," also heavily down-sampled.
  - A still from the movie "STAR WARS", also rendered at very low
    resolution

For my own standalone tools, these are licensed under GPL. See
COPYING. Other software incorporating 3rd-party open source software
contains licensing details therein.
