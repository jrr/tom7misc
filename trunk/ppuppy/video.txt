"in fact this behavior is required by law" (show sticker on the
back of game/console)

self-reference is not itself funny. "Hi, my name is Tom."

retro is not funny. the present already contains the past.
anachronism is funny: it's wrong, a surprise, that something
from the future exists in the past

emotional rollercoaster
 - First I'm going to tell you something that sounds impressive,
   then you will be disappointed when you find out I "cheated",
   then you will perhaps be impressed again when you find out
   how hard it was even to cheat,
   and then you will be disappointed with the actual results,
   and then you might be happy again to discover that it's not
   really "cheating"

I figured out why it's called "hard"-ware

temperature dependent

improper hierarchy
 - actually anachronism is an example
 - the extreme example of this is a "loop" (maybe even a "strange loop")
 - but improper hierarchy is a more general case.
 - many examples (these need fleshing out!)
    - compiler
    - 64-bit windows 7 running on VirtualBox on windows 2000.
    - cd/tape adapter
    -
 - the cart has a schematic of itself inside its own ROM
 - the signal being sent over the wires contains an image
   of the oscilloscope sampling the signal over those wires
    - could even be live??

* who's in charge here?
 - so many different processors; which one is "in charge"?
   does it matter?

* reverse emulation

* video ideas

"wrongness in computer science"

"memory knocking"
Could use this to signal the beginning of the frame,
also to communicate 

actually this reminds me of why I gave up on security
obviously I didn't like just think of this and make the
slide this second. i mean when I was making the slides.
 - one transistor bug
 - DLL signature knocking

and how do we measure latency? We use the ping command.

does mod come up? use upside-down POW block.
  (yes: mirroring)
