improper hierarchy
 - actually anachronism is an example

 - many examples (these need fleshing out!)
    - compiler
    - 64-bit windows 7 running on VirtualBox on windows 2000.
    - cd/tape adapter
    -
 - the cart has a schematic of itself inside its own ROM

* reverse emulation

* video ideas

 - one transistor bug
 - DLL signature knocking

and how do we measure latency? We use the ping command.

does mod come up? use upside-down POW block.
