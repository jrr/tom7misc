- Make negative temperatures work -- this will surely be possible
  outdoors and perhaps in the attic as well. (Check what range
  onewire supports, but AM2315 can do -40 to 125 C)
- Perhaps try to figure out the hardware versions so that you can
  get e.g. the graph from a faster machine?
- See 7.2.1 in AM2315 datasheet; we may want to track the time since
  the last read in the AM2315 module.
- Associate probes with devices in db? Any point?
- Install unattended-upgrades on each device.
- Probeid can probably be smallint unsigned not null. You can just change
  column types with alter table, no sweat.
- Periodically thin out old readings using the sample key. Probably we
  can just delete large values for the sample key, since we sample with
  <.

(In a pinch, "show processlist;" in mysql admin can likely
 show you the active connections.)

Humidity sensing:

Beware, many of these are some custom protocol. i2c is probably a much
better choice.

I ended up ordering these:

  $30 AM2315 is the wired, mountable encased one:

  $3.95 AM2320 is not wired or enclosed, but cheap:

  Looks like the same protocol as AM2315. So this is a good
  cheap option for places where humidity sensing is just a bonus.
