 - the dots in the corners seem to always be present?

 - mm seems wrong, although it is close. measuring
   corner dot to corner dot I get 1.500 inch, which
   is 15 grid cells wide. so 0.1 inch grid. Close to 2.5mm,
   which I tried before and it crashed shaper (:

 - there ARE repeated patterns even on a single roll of
   tape. I just happened to see

   * * * *   *   *
   * * *         *

   oh just kidding, the other one is this same but mirrored
   along the short axis. So, not really the same.

 - Not all the hand-made "random" markers worked. All of the scanned
   ones have even parity (white dot = 1 bit), and all but one of the
   unscanned ones have odd. So I think they are supposed to have even
   parity, and maybe some other property like a maximum number of dots.

 - If the corners are always on, then we have 12 bits of entropy, but
   minus one so that we have parity. That's only 2^11 = 2048 different
   markers, not even counting rotational symmetry!
