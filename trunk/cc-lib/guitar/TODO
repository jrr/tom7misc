npmjs.com/package/tonal-fretboard chordShapes might be an algorithmic
way to name/generate these.

Also chordictionary.com/#documentation ...

This site seems very regular and reliable:

x8776x for F6 and Dm
  .. 6 usually means "add6" so you'd still expect the
     root note to be an F. (But in piano it is sometimes
     an inversion, which would make sense here??)
  .. but I don't think this could be Dm if the root
     isn't a D, right?

Missing 7#5 and m7#5 chords; this seems to be the bulk of
the chords missing from guitarchive.


F/D has several problems in it (is it actually Dm7/A??)

C#9 has a barre with a note played BELOW the barre. Wha?
I think we'd mute the low E string too..
Lots of the 69 chords (and 9 chords) have this problem.
(I think this is actually just a bug with the rendering...
 we have a valid barre (e.g. of just the highest two strings)
 but that same fret is also fingered on another string with
 a different finger. No contradiction here. But the SVG
 outputs a barre from the first fret to the last, even if
 there should be gaps and even if the data says play with
 different fingers.)
