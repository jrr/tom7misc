        * version 2.2 released
	
	* inst.sml: Improved compatibility with other MIDI editors;
	  now any track that has only META events will be used to
	  find "end" and "loop" markers.

	* version 2.1 released
	
	* inst.sml: Fixed a bug where useless messages could
	  interrupt long notes in the middle. It's still possible
	  to be interrupted by, eg, the "loop" marker, but at
	  least useless things like sysex and program change won't
	  do it.

	* inst.sml: Added -debug option, which probably will not
	  be very useful for end-users.

	* inst.sml: Added the parameter -quantize, which allows you
	  to reduce the resolution of the MIDI time step. Generally
	  you'll want to avoid this unless you really know what
	  you're doing.

	* inst.sml: Added the ability to define instruments 
	  (see documentation).

	* inst.sml: Fixed a bug with DPCM samples. I don't know
	  how long this hasn't worked, but you should be able to
	  use more than one sample now.
