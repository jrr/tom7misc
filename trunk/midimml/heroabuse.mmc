# the QUOTE command just puts the text
# verbatim at the beginning of the mml file.
# you can stick any MML here, but midimml
# doesn't understand what you're doing, so
# it's quite easy to interfere with it.

# set everything up "standard"

QUOTE ABCDE @2 q8 v8 t230

# make the duty cycle of the A channel sound
# a little more gritty (good to distinguish 
# it from B channel)

QUOTE A @3

# Turn down the volume of A and B channels, since
# we can't turn up the (quiet) C channel
QUOTE AB v6

QUOTE #BANK-CHANGE 0,2

# Define some pitch/volume envelope macros. These can then
# be used for the instrument definitions below.

# XXX do it!

# Define instruments. There are 127 MIDI instruments.
# When switching instruments on a channel, the command(s)
# for that instrument will be output--which will, perhaps,
# result in a cumulative effect from previous instruments.
# Because of this, it's best to reset any unused settings to
# their default values (instrument 0 below gives those).

# XXX pitch sweep p?
# XXX not obvious if q and @q are mutually exclusive,
#     though @q0 makes tiny blips, if present
