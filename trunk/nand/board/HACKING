installing open ocd on pi:
sudo apt-get install git autoconf libtool make pkg-config libusb-1.0-0 libusb-1.0-0-dev
git clone http://openocd.zylin.com/openocd && cd openocd
./bootstrap
./configure --enable-sysfsgpio --enable-bcm2835gpio
make -j 2
sudo make install

I used
raspberrypi2-native.cfg

openocd.conf was:
source [find interface/raspberrypi2-native.cfg]
transport select swd

set CHIPNAME stm32f303rdt6
source [find target/stm32f3x.cfg]source [find interface/raspberrypi2-native.cfg]
transport select swd

set CHIPNAME stm32f303rdt6
source [find target/stm32f3x.cfg]

# did not yet manage to make a working setup using srst
#reset_config srst_only
reset_config  srst_nogate

adapter_nsrst_delay 100
adapter_nsrst_assert_width 100

init
targets
reset halt



then I just run "sudo openocd"

when it connects to the chip you'll see somehing like:

(The essential part being that it identifies a target!)

With the wrong connections (etc.), you will see most of this including
(SWD DPIDR 0xblahblah, and Info: Listening on ...) but not the things
between that.

Connected to BCM 11 (swdclk) and BCM 25 (swdio), plus 3v3 and GND
of course. NRST not needed it seems. but I had to have BOOT0 connected
to 3v3 in order to get openocd to connect. (I think I probably
manually reset after connecting this, using the button)

(Note that the wiring info on the adafruit link is just wrong. trust
the openocd config)

for "program" command you probably need to provide an offset.

use openocd -d to run in debugging mode (LOTS of output).
It actually seemed to work in this mode, supporting the hypothesis
that I just need to slow the data rate.

well actually, now it's just magically fixed?!


I think it may just be flakey and need me to go slower, so I
modified the stm32f3x.cfg so that in stm32f3x_default_reset_init, it sets the frequency to 1000 khz, not 8000 khz.
(actually made local copies of the two .cfg files)

even 1000 khz is super fast... 21kb/sec to write, 320kb/sec to verify


ok, so my procedure for programming is like:
 - connect BOOT0 to 3v3 (yellow wire)
 - reboot (e.g. reset switch)
 - "sudo openocd", reading from main.bin

At this point, reset switch doesn't seem to work!
However, upon removing power to the nand board, and restoring it,
the program definitely seems to be running. So I think this is the
right way to reset, for unknown reasons.

Actually just kidding: new hypothesis is that I need to tie
BOOT0 to ground when resetting; otherwise it is just floating
and you have a good chance of booting into system mode. So probably
the board should have a dip switch (or pull-down?), but fortunately
there's a pin in the "SWD" header that I can just jumper.

I was able to get it to strobe between output pins, after getting
it to blink them synchronously... so I'm pretty confident that
it is working, if possibly flaky.
