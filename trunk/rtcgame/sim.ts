// TODO: Frame index representation! 32 bits is seemingly not enough?
// (810 days at 60fps, but we really do want simulations to be able to
// persist indefinitely and assume the frame counter is monotonic).
// Would be nice to use BigInt but it's not available in Safari yet
// (it's in TP so maybe it's still a reasonable choice, like maybe it
// comes out with the next version of iOS even?) Could use a pair of
// 32-bit ints and implement simple number ops manually, too.

// expected properties (e.g. determinism) of zipStep/step/etc. given
// an actual production implementation of Ops.
