Registering a file type:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/how-to-register-a-file-type-for-a-new-application
This is pretty weird but the docs look right.
First you create like HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\fastview.jpg which is your ProgID.
(I think the right granularity is basically... do you want it to have a different icon?
 If not, they can all just point to FastView)
It can have DefaultIcon and shell > open > command, which the latter is like
  "c:\program files\fastview\fastview.exe" "%1"
Then you also have HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.jpg
 .. many of these just have the equivalent of: (Default) REG_SZ "fastview.jpg"
    and sometimes also Content Type REG_SZ "image/jpeg"
    and PerceivedType REG_Z "image"
Others instead have \OpenWithProgids folder with (among others) "fastview.jpg" REG_SZ ""
 .. as well as folders like OpenWithList and PersistentHandler.
Not sure what to make of that.

Rather than actually making the association for .jpg files, it probably makes sense
to let the user (i.e. me) set that from the shell. So I think we should be looking
for a way to tell the shell that fastview.exe makes sense for this kind of file so
that it appears in lists? (Or perhaps don't even bother... looks like you can select
any program and just "always use this program").
