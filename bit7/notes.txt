Need to decide whether an 8x8 font should include inter-letter and inter-line spacing?

If not:
 - Sorta makes sense; a letter is 8x8 pixels.
 - Works best on a hardware display that is e.g. 8 pixels tall.
 - Storage is perhaps more efficient, if this row/col would always be blank

If so:
 - Matches what terminal fonts usually do?
 - Makes blitting simpler, although not by much
 - Makes metrics somewhat simpler? (n character word is just 8n x 8)
 - Drawing characters can still use the space, so that we get nice contiguous
   lines / shades on these. (This is probably the clincher!)
 - Can fudge a little in a pinch, like lowercase g

We could also offer multiple versions of the font, if like these danger zones
are "optional" (e.g. they are only used by drawing characters) then we could
generate a version that drops them.

I guess the main thing I like about not including them is that it would be very
reasonable to have a 8 pixel-tall hardware LED display and want to load an 8x8
pixel font there. But we could also just have a design intent note that says
the bottom row and right column can be safely dropped, as these are just used
for spacing or continuity in drawing characters. We'd have to avoid 'fudge' in
this case, but otherwise this seems like the best way to go.
