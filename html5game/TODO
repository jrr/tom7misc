HTML5Game TODO:

 - Controller support!

 - Drums in MIDI support!

 - Would be nice if we could build resources directly into
   javascript, like as encoded base64 (or even some fancier
   compression). Then we could build the game with some
   makefile and not need a web server.

 - Box2d integration / example?!
