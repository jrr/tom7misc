 - but the "engine" is almost working

10 things:
 - shooting guy puzzle
 - airlock puzzle
 - captain puzzle
 - end credits using music
 - ship graphics detail
 - atmospheric music/sound



get extinguisher,
put out fire,
6x1 free
get id
kill grate guy
get screwdriver

saturday
 - game basically working
 - start to finish playable?
 - are all music channels playing?

assets
 - set up areas for whole game
 - teleport entrance anim
 - main game atmospheric music
 - grate guy
   - grate guy death anim
 - airlock guy
   - airlock guy death
 - guy uselessly shooting you
 - captain lady
 - ovoposit animation
 - self-destruct
 - end / credits
 - frown face (for like rejecting action)
 - mouth moving face for talking out loud

must have
 - name for game
 - come up with efficient art "look"
 - title screen with name on it
 - incorporate "normal" (dissonant) title theme (at end?)

nice
 - improve path planning if areas have cycles...
 - slow smooth space background (nebulae etc.). Helps highlight
    the font and ship outline, looks better
 - animate grate guy while he's standing there. whistle (notes) (sfx?)
   tap toe, look left and right

 - animate egg
 - intro scene, warping to ship
 - (MUTE) state instead of SILENCED
 - title theme could be improved
 - slow down title theme a little
 - make it work with touch events 

polish
 - font colors
 - font emphasis (vibrating letters)
 - scanline animation for inventory icon / actual
 - clean up and shade main character arms
 - fix click sound in title theme
 - lowercase space font?

how many humans? 4 eggs in inventory would fit, but no more (if 2x2)
could also be non-human enemies (e.g. cyborg crewmate)
 - grate guy
 - airlock guy (but doesn't the body get sucked out into space?)
 - guy uselessly shooting
 - captain lady
 
this is probably the minimum that would work, so let's go for it.
can always add non-humans.

For each death, you should have to solve an inventory-packing puzzle.

- maybe it's impossible to drop things? this would allow the puzzles
  to get harder over time

ideas:
 - "TALK" action is mostly humor, but necessary to scare one human
   into the airlock? 

== INTRO

 - teach inventory system, require at least picking up an item
   and using it to breach a wall or something?
 - should happen underneath 

 - ship is obviously moving fast, so alien ship needs to be
   tracking it

== GRATE GUY

 - death before they even know you are aboard.
 - should not be a threatening character. maybe scientist etc.
 - pull him down into cargo hold
 - can get something to open the grate

== AIRLOCK GUY

 - when you encounter these two, they first nervously like, try
   to talk to you
   
 - talking to either one of them makes airlock guy run to airlock,
   militant guy hide behind crates

 - somehow they should block you from progressing here until you talk?
   (portashield?)
   or else there should just be nothing

 - airlock "emergency" tool to kill
 - requires figuring out that you can ovoposit egg in crate guy's face,
   to free space (key discovery)
 - doesn't the body get sucked out into space?
 - maybe you then need to solve an intermediate puzzle to go out there
   and find the body to ovoposit it
   (eggs in space? maybe it's fine. the alien can just go out in space
   with no issues I guess?)

== USELESSLY SHOOTING GUY

 - I like this guy just waging war on you for most of the game, so
   he should maybe be second-to-last.
 - shoots at you (does nothing), maybe lobs grenades
 - takes cover in some crates
 - kill how? (Need something big... portoshield?)

== CAPTAIN LADY

 - should die with dignity
 - barricades herself in the bridge. should not be out of cowardice but
   out of duty (why?). She could carry on a dialog with fleet command,
   asking for backup or something.
 - goal is to break into the bridge (what items)?
   this one should be last so you should have to collect a lot of items
   and arrange them in inventory

 - when you get in there she should keep calmly talking
