 - Some way to set auto coordinates, to make level editing
   easier.
 - Jump timer for 'big' vs 'little' jumps
 - Moving a tesselation all at once.
 - check that deleting nodes keeps a tesselation in a good state.
 - reimplement keyed tesselation check()
 - put tesselation triangles in canonical order?
 - split editing code out from otolith.sml
 - history to rendering, so that when an object just pops into
   existence we can animate that; vectors for moving nodes too.
   Important to get this flexibility right early.
 - in trymovenode, move to the closest position that's ok?
 - In editor mode, help/info window
 - better UI isolation when editing objects
 - could pretty easily (expensively) compute the union of all pixels
   that an object can occupy, and draw that contour when an object is
   selected.
 - when flipping edges, do angle check
