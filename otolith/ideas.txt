Should be possible to make an elevator if the physics are done right;
imagine that the top edge of the elevator floor is mapped exactly to
whatever pixel is the area source (say the bottom of the player's feet),
but up a single pixel. Now it moves itself into that space, which pushes
the player up one pixel, which continues indefinitely.
... note that if you jump, the elevator floor will follow you.

... Probably possible to make a "launcher" where the floor follows you
up, but backs off.


If objects on the screen would interfere with one another, should that
prevent the player from moving into that area? Could make all sorts of
puzzles with this, but maybe it would be too confusing.
(Could just be a certain kind of wall, like a different color?)


Monster that is a segment attached to the walls, traveling along it.
Can destroy it by splitting it in two, or crushing it?
