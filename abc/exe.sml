      (* Pages in file.

         Number of 512-byte pages. Since the maximum size is 1MB, we
         also have to give an invalid value here, but DOSBox ANDs the
         value with 07ff. We have a wide range of values available
         here; the most-significant byte can be 20 to 27, covering
         that whole range because the 2 gets ANDed off, and the LSB
         can be anything printable (20 to 7e). The largest value we
         can use here is 0x2f7e (not 7e7e), which yields 1918 pages.

         We can use so little of the file for anything meaningful; it's
         basically just the code and data segments, each at 64k, and
         this huge useless header before that where we store the paper
         and some untouchable stuff like the relocation table.

         The last byte we actually need to store in the file is the
         end of the code segment, which starts at (paragraph) 0x2020
         and runs 65536 bytes. ((0x2020 * 16 + 65536) div 512) = 385,
         so this gives us a good starting point for the minimum possible
         size. But of course we need a header. 0x217e is just shy
         of 385 anyway, and the next biggest printable value is 0x2220,
         which gives us 544 pages. At this size, even with the
         smallest possible header (0x2020 * 16 bytes), the 64k of code
         doesn't fit in the image. 0x227e is merely 2kb shy, ugh! So
         0x2320 seems to be the smallest workable value here, for 800
         pages. (Maybe could get smaller if header used CR/LF.) *)
      val pages = w16v (Word16.fromInt 0x2320)

         The image size, which we need to keep small to fit in memory,
         is (head.pages & 07ff) * 512 - head.headersize * 16.

         For the setting of "pages" above, the minimum value of 0x2020
         works. It's much larger than the actual header, but it helps
         make the memory requirements of the program smaller by
         reducing the amount of the file that needs to be loaded into
         memory (only the part after the header is loaded). This is a
         potential issue because we also have to declare a minimum
         memory requirement of 0x2020 below. (We also get some space
         to put the paper :)) *)

         Useful for programs that can change segment registers to
         allocate some space. But this space will be basically useless
         to us. Also, we need the total memory requirement of our program
         to be small, since DOS only has about 40,000 paragraphs to
         give us. Note that this value gets shifted up by 4 bits, so it
         would be nice to be able to shift off some high bits (e.g. supply
         0x7020, yielding 0x0200.), but at least in DOSBox this calculation
         is done at 32-bit width. So the smallest we can manage is 0x2020.

         Note that the memory check includes this value and the image
         size, which is the file size (head.pages) minus the header
         size. See the sanity check below. *)

         I believe this is specified the same way as the code segment

         should probably be within the program image + allocated
         memory above. We could initialize the stack segment with some
         data, but this grows the size of the executable and is
         difficult to manage (DOS will corrupt the stack segment at
         arbitrary times with interrupts, including during
         initialization, and we don't have access to the instructions
