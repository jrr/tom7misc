ASCII-only load_ax16. First attempt:
  Total bytes: 287248 (avg 4.38)
use INC, DEC:
  Total bytes: 268848 (avg 4.10)
also use AND:
  Total bytes: 231810 (avg 3.54)
don't wrap around INC:
  Total bytes: 231822 (avg 3.54)
bug fix (shoudln't change length):
  Total bytes: 231822 (avg 3.54)

There are still lots of really bad sequences...



357 bytes for EXE HEADER program (non-ascii)

ASCII version (other than INTs)
# of code bytes: 415

Use existing correct value of AH:
# of code bytes: 224

Implemented some known 16-to-16 ops, making it worse!:
# of code bytes: 229


before Machine rewrite:
WriteTest.writeexe();
# of code bytes: 320


after machine rewrite:
Total bytes: 231822 (avg 3.54)  (ok good)


after Machine rewrite:
# of code bytes: 300    :)

... I'm also not using any 16-bit tricks in there.

with 16-bit tricks:
# of code bytes: 285
