  (* Optimizations TODO:
     - Reuse temporaries.
     - Replace locals with temporaries
        (Should this be done in CIL though? Can't do it for
         stuff that spans blocks there.)
        (Is it even faster, anyway? I guess it would cut
         down on moves between locals and "registers")
     - A handful of operators can use immediate values, at
       least printable ones. *)

  (* Notes on translation strategy:

     - The comparison operators are some trouble; we don't
       something like cmov, so we have to do a compare-
       and-jump in order to compute the values. (It would
       maybe be possible to subtract and check the sign
       bit manually, but it's pretty fiddly.) So before
       translating to ASM, we need to replace the
       comparison expressions with the versions that
       compare and branch at once. (XXX need to add these
       to CIL.)

     - all temporaries are either 16 or 32 bits.
       many 8-bit operations are available to us, but
       it adds lots of complexity.
