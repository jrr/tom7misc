Linux: ELF files start with 0x7F, DEL. Several bytes have to be 0.

Need to check Mach-O for OS X.

COM is easy (no header even), but limited to 64k. But maybe could read
itself and map its own memory; overlays, etc. Also not sure this can
be 32-bit mode?

MS-DOS EXE may be possible. A troublesome field is the "overlay",
which is normally 0 and not frequently used. It may be ignored...

PE (win32 and 64-bit) is no good. The magic 0x50450000 in the COFF
header contains zeroes. To skip the optional header (which seems to
require zeroes), the size would probably have to be zero?
