These are common in for loops without break or continue:
 - fuse blocks with unconditional goto and no other entry points
 - reverse goto of !cond when it's the only use of the label.

 - Track whether a variable is already the result of a
   comparison (or more generally, whether it is known
   to be 0 or 1). Avoid !!b, which we use in the translation
   of && and ||.
