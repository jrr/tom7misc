          MOV ESI <- [EBX]
       or
          MOV ESI <- [EBX]+'a'     (of course note we do not have MOV instruction)
       EBX is a fairly useless register, since it can't be the REG argument except
       when using [REG]+disp32 as R/M, and all registers can be used that way. By
       keeping it a constant value, we can use the following slots as temporaries:
          [EBX], i.e. DS:00000100 (available registers are ESP, EBP, ESI, EDI)
          [EBX]+0x20, i.e. DS:00000120 (all registers available)
          ...
          [EBX]+0x7e, i.e. DS:0000017e (all registers available)

       0 would be an obvious choice for the constant value, but DS:0000 contains 256
       bytes of the PSP, which we want to keep:
          - it contains the command line and maybe some other useful stuff from the
            program's environment.
          - it's guaranteed to contain INT 21; RETF (at DS:0050), which we could use
            to do system calls without self-modifying code if we could get the right
            stuff on the stack and somehow get control here (it's in range of a JNO 0x7e
            at the end of the address space, so this seems possible.)
       The base value basically doesn't matter. I think everything here works fine with
       different values TEMP_START (up to 0xFFFF - 0x7E). We may need to preserve other
       parts of the data segment, though, such as the region right before the address space
       wraps.

       This is lots of temporaries, so that's nice. It's also critical because it's
       the only way we can do math ops like XOR on non-immediate values. Example:
          Get DS:0100 to contain V2
          PUSH AX
          POP BP
          XOR BP <- [EBX]
          PUSH BP
          POP AX
       or
          Get DS:0120 to contain V2
          XOR AX <- [EBX]+0x20

       Note that we also have disp32 available, but this is basically useless in
       real mode because all printable values will overflow the segment.
