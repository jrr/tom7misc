Sorry about that!

Not all of the ASCII bytes are considered printable, either. For example,
0x14 means DEVICE CONTROL 4 in ASCII, forever enshrined as that useless
idea. Even DOS didn't think it was useful, so DOS prints it as a
"paragraph" symbol. The byte 0x07 just makes a beep sound if you try to
display it.


The range of reliable characters are:

   0x0A   NEWLINE
   0x0D.  CARRIAGE RETURN
   0x20.  SPACE
   ...
   0x7E.  ~

.. and no others. 0x0A and 0x0D are actually pretty questionable, because
UNIX, MacOS and DOS/Windows could not agree on whether a line ends with
newline, carriage return, or carriage return and then newline. This paper
is concerned with reliably printable characters, so we say that's the
95 characters from 0x20 to 0x7E, inclusive.



I was kidding when I said the x86 architecture is elegant.
