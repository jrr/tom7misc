Hello, and welcome to my paper! I'm really happy to have you here! <3

In this paper, I describe a new compiler for the C89 programming language.

For good  reasons that  I will  explain later, this  paper must  be 20
pages long. Due to unreasonable  SIGBOVIK deadlines, I did not produce
enough technical  material to fill the  minimum number of pages,  so I
will  be  somewhat  prolix  and  I  have  inserted  several  unrelated
ASCII-art drawings.


    ** Typesetting note **

If you receive this  paper in a raw text file, it  may be difficult to
read  because of  its two-column  layout. It  should be  typeset in  a
monospace font  on pages 160  characters wide and 128  characters tall
(this is 4x  the typical density of  a line printer from  the 1980s or
1990s). Many pages,  including parts of this first  one, have cropping
marks outside  the text body to  make the correct alignment  easier to
verify. This file contains no  carriage returns or newlines; each line
just contains 160 characters and is padded with spaces. If you receive
this paper in the SIGBOVIK proceedings, it may be hard to read because
it is printed in a very small font to conserve paper. Squinting really
hard to read hard fonts is good exercise for your eyes.

Your antivirus  software may detect  this paper  as a virus,  for good
reasons that I will describe later. It is not a virus. ;-)

This program was typeset with a special tool, described in Section XXX.


    ** Introduction **

On any  normal computer,  a program  is just a  data file.  It usually
contains some header information that tells the operating system about
what it is (for example, to confirm  that it is a program and not some
other kind of file; to tell the operating system about how much memory
it needs,  or the  libraries it  depends on,  etc.) and  then contains
commands for  the processor  to execute. I'm  not talking  about stuff
like  shell  scripts and  Python  programs,  which contain  text-based
commands (like  10 PRINT  "HI") interpreted by  some other  program. I
mean real executable files. These  commands are low level instructions
called opcodes, and are usually just  a few bytes each. Maybe just one
byte. For  example, on the  popular and elegant X86  architecture, the
single byte 0xF4  is the "HLT" instruction, which  halts the computer.
(Could this be  why ALT-F4 is the universal key  code for quitting the
current program?  Intriguing!) (Of course, some  instructions like HLT
are  strictly off  limits for  "user space"  programs. When  running a
program, the  operating system  puts the processor  into a  mode where
such  rude instructions  instead  alert the  operating  system to  the
program's  misbehavior. We'll  talk  more about  rude instructions  in
Section XXX.) The single byte 0x40 means "INC AX" -- add 1 to the "AX"
register -- and a multibyte sequence like  XX XX XX means XXX. All the
time, the  computer is just reading  the next byte out  of the program
(or  operating  system, itself  a  program  written using  these  same
instructions), doing what it says to do, and then going on to the next
one.

I wrote  the opcodes above  in hexadecimal notation, but  they're just
stored in the files and memory as raw bytes (like all files). The byte
0xF4 is  not considered "printable" because  old-timey computer people
couldn't agree on how it should look.  In DOS, it's the top half of an
integral sign, like this:

                        . . . . . . . . .
                        . . . . . . . . .
                        . . . . @@@@@@. .
                        . . . @@@@. @@@@.
                        . . . @@@@. @@@@.
                        . . . @@@@. . . .
                        . . . @@@@. . . .
                        . . . @@@@. . . .
                        . . . @@@@. . . .
                        . . . @@@@. . . .
                        . . . @@@@. . . .
                        . . . @@@@. . . .
                        . . . @@@@. . . .
                        . . . @@@@. . . .
                        . . . @@@@. . . .
                        . . . @@@@. . . .

The first half of all bytes (0x00 to 0x7F) are defined in ASCII, which
is standard  across almost all computers  now. When you look  at the @
symbols in the picture above, they are almost certainly represented as
the byte  0x40, which means  the character @ in  ASCII. And so  if you
peered directly  at the  bytes in this  file, you would  see a  lot of
0x40s in that region, and right here when I put another at sign: --> @
<--.  Sometimes  the  @  sign  can  be the  flower  of  a  rose,  like
@>-,--'---. To  the processor,  it means  INC AX,  since 0x40  is that
opcode.

Now,  for good  reasons that  I will  explain later,  this paper  must
contain 8,224 repetitions of the string "p~9(". Please proceed to Page
