    ** 28. PAPER.EXE **

Executing this paper in DOS, with an AdLib-compatible sound card (such
as the Sound  Blaster) configured at 0x388, will play  some music. The
music to play  is specified on the  command line, using a  subset of a
standard  text-based music  format called  ABC [ABC'05]. For  example,
invoking

PAPER.EXE C4C4G4G4A4A4G8G8F4F4E4E4D4D4C8

will play a segment  of the "Now I know my ABC's"  song and then exit.
The language supported is as follows:

  A-G   Basic notes
  a-g   Same, up one octave
    z   Rest
    ^   (Prefix) Sharp
    _   (Prefix) Flat
    =   (Prefix) Natural - does nothing since key of C is assumed
    '   (Suffix) Up one octave
    ,   (Suffix) Down one octave
  2-8   (Suffix) Set duration of note to this many eighth notes

Running PAPER.EXE  with arguments  like "-song"  will play  a built-in
song.   Available   songs   include:  "-alphabet",   "-plumber",   and
"-bluehair". There's  plenty of  space in the  data segment  for more!

Running PAPER.EXE without any arguments will play a default song.


    ** 28. Running, debugging **

Speaking of running the program, old-style  EXE files no longer run on
64-bit versions of Windows. So if you  do not have an old DOS computer
around with a sound card, you  can run ABC-compiled programs inside an
emulator. DOSBox  is an excellent choice.  It runs on pretty  much all
platforms (well, it  doesn't run on DOS,  but on DOS you  can just use
DOS) and tends to just work. You have to do something like

   MOUNT C C:\DOWNLOADS\ABC\

in order to mount  one of your real directories as  a "hard drive". To
verify  that  PAPER.EXE   is  printable  with  no   beeping  or  funny
characters, you could do

   COPY PAPER.EXE CON

to copy it to your console, or  COPY PAPER.EXE LPT1 to copy it to your
simulated computer's printer  (spoiler: It doesn't have  one). But why
bother? You're reading PAPER.EXE right now!

I  used  DOSBox  frequently   during  development,  and  modified  its
debugger, especially for understanding  the header values are actually
used. The ABC compiler outputs  each of the intermediate languages for
a program  as it compiles,  as well as lightly-commented  X86 assembly
with address maps back into the  code segment, which makes it possible
to  easily  set  breakpoints  on  particular  pieces  of  code.  Since
compiling other people's software on Windows is a special nightmare, I
frequently  worked   inside  a  Linux  virtual   machine  (VirtualBox)
containing a DOS  virtual machine (DOSBox), a surreal  scenario that I
was  tickled to  find a  practical use  for. Let  us one  day simulate
Windows 7  on our iPhones  21 so that  we may render  this development
environment one level deeper.

My modifications to DOSBox are  included in the ABC source repository,
although they  are not  necessary to  run ABC-compiled  programs. When
running these programs under DOSBox with the debugger enabled, it will
complain  about a  "weird  header" when  loading  the program  (you're
tellin' me!) and the debugger will output the error

        Illegal/Unhandled opcode 63

upon exiting (because  we do execute an illegal  opcode). For cosmetic
style points, the local version of DOSBox has been modified to instead
output


        Thank you for playing Wing Commander!



    ** 29. PAPER.C **

This section  contains the C source  code that was compiled  into this
paper.  It  may be  interesting  to  see  how  the code  (e.g.  string
literals) make  their way into  the data for  the paper. You  may also
laugh at my many troubles:

 - I'm playing music, which has some dependency on timing, but there
   is no way to get access to the system clock. Instead, I use for
   loops with built-in constants determined empirically. At least
   this technique of relying on the CPU's cycle timing for delays
   was common in the DOS era, so this is, like, a period piece.

 - However, since the routine that calculates lengths performs a
   multiplication, and multiplication of m * n is O(n), the delays
   are not actually linear.

 - You can see the many places where I'm applying explicit casts,
   either because an implicit coercion is not yet implemented for
   ABC (I want to do it right, and the rules are a little subtle),
   because some operation is not yet available at char or long type
   (I implemented 16-bit first), or for efficiency.
   
 - You can see the reliance on string literals for efficient lookup
   tables, in keeping with the "printable" theme.

I also still need to fill up 20 pages in this ridiculously small font!

    ** 30. Is this useful for anything? **

No. This is a SIGBOVIK paper. <3


    ** 31. Future work **

There are many code size  optimizations possible, and while nontrivial
programs can fit in  64k (such as the one in  this paper), larger ones
will run up against that boundary  quickly. Probably a factor of about
4 can be gained through  a few hard but straightforward optimizations.
Can we  break free  of the  64k boundary? Earlier  we noted  that when
execution  exceeds CS:0xFFFF,  it  simply  continues to  CS:0x00010000
unless  a jump  is  executed  across that  boundary;  this address  is
pointing to  bytes that are  part of our  program image (this  text is
there,  in  fact),  so  conceivably  we could  write  code  here.  One
significant  issue is  that interrupts,  which are  constantly firing,
push  16-bit versions  of CS  and  IP onto  the stack,  and then  RETF
(return far) to that address. This  means that if an interrupt happens
while we are executing in this  extended address space, we will return
to CS:(EIP & 0xFFFF). If we had control over interrupts, this might be
a  good way  to return  to the  normal 16-bit  code segment  (i.e., to
perform a backwards jump), but as discussed, we do not. We may be able
to  globally suppress  interrupts, like  by using  our single  illegal
instruction  interrupt  during   initialization,  with  the  interrupt
handler pointing  just to  code that we  control (and  never returning
from it).  This leaves the  interrupt flag cleared, as  discussed. The
computer will  be non-functional in  many ways, because  the operating
system  will  no  longer  run,  but  we might  still  be  able  to  do
rudimentary port-based  I/O, or build our  own non-interrupt-based OS.
With interrupts suppressed, we can't use the interrupt trick to return
to CS:0000.  However, my reading of  the Intel manual [INTC]  seems to
imply that a jump performed from this region can be forced into 16-bit
mode (thus  being subject to  the &  0xFFFF overflow) with  an address
size prefix;  however, this does  not seem to  be the case  in DOSBox.
Given how unusual this situation is, it  may even be a bug in DOSBox's
CPU emulator. Having access to a full megabyte of code (it still needs
to fit in  the EXE container) would be exciting,  since it would allow
us to build much more significant  systems (e.g. standard malloc and a
floating point emulator); more investigation is warranted here.


I initially  designed CIL with the  thought that it could  be used for
multiple such  "compile C to  X" projects. These are  primarily jokes,
but   can   occasionally   be   of  legitimate   use   for   low-level
domain-specific tasks where the existence of a reasonable and familiar
high-level syntax  pays for  the effort of  writing a  simple backend.
(When making such a  decision I like to also weight  the effort by the
enjoyment of each task: i.e., the cost is like

   (1 - fun of writing backend) * time writing backend   vs
   (pain of writing low-level code by hand) *
       time writing low-level code by hand
       
... but I have been informed that not all computer work is done purely
for fun.) This "portable assembler"  application of C remains relevant
today, and CIL or LLVMNOP is a much simpler than GCC or LLVM.

Anyway, I discovered that  the design of such a thing  is not so easy.
While it  is possible  to "compile away"  certain features  by turning
them into  something "simpler," it's not  straightforward what feature
set to  target. For example, for  ABC, we compile away  the | operator
into &, ^, -,  and +1. In another setting, | may  very well be present
instead of &.  We normally think of  the >> and <<  shift operators as
being  fundamental, but  in  ABC  they are  inaccessible.  I find  the
expression forms  like "a  < b"  much easier to  think about  then the
combined test-and-branch version,  but the latter is  much better when
targeting x86, and  important for producing reasonable code  in ABC. I
do think it would be possible to develop a simple and general language
for  this niche  where certain  constructs could  be compiled  away in
favor of others,  at the direction of the compiler  author, but such a
thing is firmly future work.


On the topic of taking away, one might ask: What is the minimal subset
of bytes we could imagine using?

There  are  some  trivial  subtractions:   We  never  emit  the  BOUND
instruction (0x62, lowercase b) and it  does not seem useful; a few of
the segment prefix instructions are also unused. The instructions like
"ASCII Adjust After Addition" are currently unused, but since they act
on AX  in a predictable  way, they could  provide ways to  improve the
routines to  load immediate values.  But we're talking  about reducing
the  surface, not  increasing it.  And speaking  of loading  immediate
values, we do certainly make use  of the entire set of printable bytes
in these routines  (as arguments to XOR, SUB, PUSH,  etc.), but on the
other hand, we can also reach any value from a known starting point by
INC and DEC, taking at most  0x7FFF instructions (half the size of the
code segment, unfortunately).  More essential is our ability  to set a
register to a known value, which  today requires two or more printable
values whose bitwise AND is 0.  Sadly, though we could go through some
pains to remove bytes from the gamut here and there, no natural subset
like  "only  lowercase  letters"  or "alphanumeric"  jumps  out  as  a
straightforward extension;  we rely  on the control  flow in  the late
lowercase letters  (Jcc) and  the basic ops  in the  early punctuation
(AND/XOR), not to mention that the  EXE header barely works within the
existing constraints with access to  both "small" (0x2020) and "large"
(0x7e7e) constants.

Others  have produced  compilers  for high-level  languages with  very
reduced instruction  sets. In  an extreme  case, Dolan  shows [MOV'13]
that the mov  instruction on its own is  Turing-complete (note however
that this requires a "single absolute jump" to the top of the program,
an issue similar to what we encounter in printable x86, only we do not
cheat   by   inserting   any   out-of-gamut   instructions).   Another
enterprising programmer, Domas, implemented a C compiler that produces
only MOV instructions [MVF'16]. I didn't  look at it while writing ABC
(spoilers!) but he avoids using any  JMP instruction the same way that
I exit the program (generating  illegal instructions but rewriting the
interrupt handler).  While awesome, the problem  is somewhat different
from what  ABC solves; here  we are fundamentally concerned  with what
bytes  appear in  the executable,  which influences  what opcodes  are
accessible (and their arguments and  addressing modes), but is not the
only  constraint created.  For example,  in MOV-only  compilation, the
program's header  does not need  to consist only of  MOV instructions,
and so the compiler's output does  not suffer the same severe code and
data limitations  that DOS EXEs  do. (The executables it  produces are
extremely   large  and   slow;  they   also  seem   to  have   non-MOV
initialization code.)  The MOV instruction  is also very rich,  and no
versions of it are printable!

Of  course, everyone  knows that  even  unary numbers  (just like  one
symbol repeated a given number of times) is Turing complete, via Godel
encoding. So what's the big deal?
