\section{Introduction}

% texticutable

% ``characters'' ``words'' and ``paragraphs'' and ``pages''

% Literate executable, knuth
% In the dead space of the binary, put this paper or part of it

% ``PISC'' = Printable Instruction Set Computer, etc.

It's a common experience that each time you program a solution to a
hard problem, you do it a different way, due to a lack of complete
satisfaction with the way you did it last time. True to form, the
ABC compiler exercises this technique *within the same compiler*,
using a different approach to represent each of the intermediate
languages.

Thank you for playing wing commander.

TODO: Convert byte table thing into ascii. Unfortunately can't fit
the whole 256x256 thing, so maybe 128x128 with a small amount of
cropping, then a 1:1 zoom on the sierpinski triangle part?

this page confirms the wrap-around with jumps btw:
http://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/Jcc.html
(Probably already in the x86 manual actually?)

Another possibility is to include readable debug information (e.g.
frame layouts) in a separate section.

BTW here is eicar:

X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*

It does indeed use self-modifying code to create the interrupt
instructions, which it uses to print the string and exit.

histogram of actual bytes used in code segment?

interesting bugs:
  DI <- [DI]

write about load16 tmp <- tmp; it's amazing now.
(benchmark history shows performance gains..)

words contained in this paper

``interrupt is a way of telling the operating system: Check this out!''

style points for:
- put relocations a little later after CS, so that we can mark
  with text the spot where they go.

opportunity for style points, like making your phone number into
a word:

 j ? X 4 ?   (4 can alternatively be $ or ,) 

 NEED TO FIX:
  - some kind of output other than \_putc

 TOP PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:
  - don't jump at end of every block
  - don't assume a block needs to be split just because it's 0x7e-0x20.
    measure from the last jump!

The CISC Ridiculous

ascii art in paper

awesome text art headings?

Truly self-documenting
Giving new meaning to "program committee" "evaluating" my paper
For good reasons that I will explain later...
