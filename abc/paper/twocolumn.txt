. Here is a page of printed text using typical line-printer settings of 80x66.    least be done with the content before I try laying out out, since if I like  .
. I gave myself a border so that it's pretty easy to see the appropriate width    inserted a single line in column 1, it'd be a huge pain to have to reflow    .
. when just looking at an unformatted dump. At this size, each page is exactly    the WHOLE DOCUMENT!                                                          .
. 5280 bytes. With an executable of 715264 bytes, that's 135 pages (yikes).                                                                                    .

. This does seem like a pretty reasonable resolution for reading and editing,     eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad       .
. though, and it's suitably authentic. Even if we used an uncomfortably large     minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut              .
. 4x size of 160x132 (like by printing 4 ASCII pages per page?) it'd still be     aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in                    .
. 33 pages, which is a bit much for SIGBOVIK. And what would we even fill it      reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla          .
. with? Better to just put some 'meta' stuff in the printed version, like to      pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in            .
. insert 600k of spaces here, etc.                                                culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.                       .

. On the other hand, I did manage to fit over 600kb of portmantout in the 2015                                                                                 .
. edition and it was even (barely) readable?                                            III. Some more crap                                                    .

. Minimally we need to print the whole code segment, which is 64k, and                                                                                         .
. probably the whole data segment at 64k as well. At 80x66, this is 12.4          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do              .
. pages of gibberish! That's about the maximum of what I could get away with,     eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad       .
. I think. Although if the program is small, it doesn't have to use the whole     minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut              .
. code segment, or there could contain readable text somewhere in there...        aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in                    .

. OK, new executable size, which may be minimal, is 409600. This would be         pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in            .
. 77 pages at a conservative 80x66. 77 pages is still absurd, but it's getting    culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.                       .
. into the realm of possibility (double-sided, this is "only" 38 sheets).                                                                                      .

. At 4-up size, we'd come in at 19.39 pages (10 sheets). 4-up would look          eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad       .
. kind of stupid, but maybe we could do an elaborate ASCII two-column layout?     minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut              .
. At least that would look cool, but it might be very hard to read?               aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in                    .
