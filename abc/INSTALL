Notes on compiling and package dependencies     18 Feb 2017



There's a fork of DOSBox with a few local modifications
in the dosbox/ subdirectory. See dosbox/README.TOM7 for
compiling on linux.


To build ABC with sml/nj, you need ml-yacc (ugh)
apt-get install ml-yacc



Note that this source code is set up to compile with both SML/NJ (for
its interactive toplevel) and MLton (superior performance and
correctness; command-line interface). One consequence is that there
are two build files (abc.cm and abc.mlb) that must be maintained in
parallel. Another is that code must be written in the subset of SML
that both compilers support. Of particular note:
  - SML/NJ does not have a built-in Word16 structure; this type
    is obviously useful for a 16-bit real-mode compiler! I use
    my drop-in replacement from sml-lib, which is fine except that
    there is no way to get word literals to work. So instead of
    writing 0wxFFFF, write Word16.fromInt 0xFFFF.
  - I also use vectors of word8 all over. In mlton, the types
    Word8.word Vector.vector and Word8Vector.vector are equivalent,
    but not so in SML/NJ. Beware that these are used consistently.
    (There is little need for polymorphism surrounding these, so
    I just use Word8Vector.vector everywhere.)
