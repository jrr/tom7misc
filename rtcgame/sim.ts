// Sketch of simulation

// TODO: Some of this code is generic "core" code and some is specific
// to an instantiation on specific states/input/step definitions.
// Annoyingly, there seems to be no clean way to make this separation
// in typescript since "static" cannot be used in either interfaces
// (to constrain a generic type parameter) or with abstract (to enforce
// that e.g. an implementation of Inputs should have a static method
// empty()). We can't use <> in typescript like templates in C++
// (I guess at the place(s) that we instantiate Sim<T> for some particular
// T, it is not making a new instance of Sim specialized to T. Rather
// the class Sim is just erased to create a single instance. So if we
// want to do dispatch based on T, we need to do that explicitly by
// having an instance of T available. T's constructor is often used; this
// is essentially what the class "is", and the constructor apparently
// has the static properties attached to it. So you could also pass T's
// constructor to Sim's constructor and save it. Not awful, but note
// that we have to do this for all static methods of Sim, too (they
// wouldn't have access to members we saved in the constructor).

// TODO: Frame index representation! 32 bits is seemingly not enough?
// (810 days at 60fps, but we really do want simulations to be able to
// persist indefinitely and assume the frame counter is monotonic).
// Would be nice to use BigInt but it's not available in Safari yet
// (it's in TP so maybe it's still a reasonable choice, like maybe it
// comes out with the next version of iOS even?) Could use a pair of
// 32-bit ints and implement simple number ops manually, too.

// A view of the simulation from a specific peer. This is distributed, so
// even though we may talk about "the" simulation, it's realized by a
// collection of these spread around the network. When the inputs are all
// up to date, they compute the same thing.
//
// A simulation has a fixed number of players N with indices 0..N-1.
// I also know which player index I am.
