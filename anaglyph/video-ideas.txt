TO-DO:
 - make regular letters version
    (should allow multiple paths? or just ugly i,j?)
Optional:
 - kerning?!
 - could improve routing in planner
 - generate tree in sml, but explore anagrams in js (table idea)

fun stuff:
 - pixels
 - 7 segment display
 - absurd letter decompositions like:

 s =    -
       c
        -
         )
        -
        
computer science stuff:
 - post correspondence problem


 video ideas:
 start with like, "if I can rearrange the letters,
                   why can't I flip them around?"
 .. then generalize.

ANAGRAPH GENERATOR

very educational video

some that don't need to break apart letters:

b and p are not actually the same shape tho :(
  preposterous = obstreperous

  digital = pigtail

some nice pairs:

  impeach groper = orange diarrhea

  vulnerability = authenticity

  donald trump = unnatural clod
                 plutocrat man

  covfefe = pee off

  youtube = fun alone = worry etc

  they might be giants = gesticulating mutely

pixel font:
  facebook = priapism = typeface = ...

  donald trump = worst hair job

Unless you've been "undemonstrably workaday",
"glarorously thumbtacked", 
you know what anagrams are.

Unless you've been portmanteau wordplay shy,
you know what anagrams are.

Unless you wage a tyrannosaur mohawk,
you know what anagrams are.

Rearranging letters to make different words.


But if you're doing this with physical letters
you know, not imaginary letters but real ones,
then why not allow me to rearrange the letters
any way I want? Like I could rearrange

I call these anagraphs, because "anaglyph" is already taken
by these kind of 3d glasses (zelda graphic) for some reason.
anagraph comes from "anag", which means anagram, and "raph",
which means "rotate and pluck h______"
