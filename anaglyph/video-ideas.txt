TO-DO:
 - make regular letters version
    (should allow multiple paths? or just ugly i,j?)
Optional:
 - kerning?!
 - could improve routing in planner
 - generate tree in sml, but explore anagrams in js (table idea)

fun stuff:
 - pixels
 - 7 segment display
 - absurd letter decompositions like:

 s =    -
       c
        -
         )
        -
        
computer science stuff:
 - post correspondence problem


 video ideas:
 start with like, "if I can rearrange the letters,
                   why can't I flip them around?"
 .. then generalize.

 linear logic
 loops u -> v -> u -> v -> ...
 extreme version: 7 segment display
 make a font that actually realizes this compositionality
 animate word transitions

ANAGRAPH GENERATOR

some that don't need to break apart letters:

b and p are not actually the same shape tho :(
  preposterous = obstreperous

  digital = pigtail

some nice pairs:

  impeach groper = orange diarrhea

  vulnerability = authenticity

  donald trump = unnatural clod
                 plutocrat man



Unless you've been "undemonstrably workaday",
"glarorously thumbtacked", 
you know what anagrams are.

Unless you've been portmanteau wordplay shy,
you know what anagrams are.

Unless you wage a tyrannosaur mohawk,
you know what anagrams are.
