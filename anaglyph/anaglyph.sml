         work, so we're trying to choose a "best" one.

         The output is a set of records, like so:
            (piece, (slot1, piecenum1), (slot2, piecenum2))
         where "piece" is the atom type being moved,
         the "slots" are character indices in the original strings,
         and the piecenums indicate which instance of the piece is
         being moved, if the letter contains multiple of them.
         (It is not specified which one is which; we just use some
         consistent assignment.)

         We additionally have a "height" for each atom. These allow
         us to move pieces simultaneous without too much overlap
         (a common defect without this is for the atoms to just move
         along the x axis through one another). See below.

         TODO: It's probably good to move sets of pieces together,
         especially entire letters..

         For this first pass, I'm not trying at all to minimize motion,
         because I just want to get a sense of what needs to improve to
         make good animations. The pairs are chosen arbitrarily. *)

      (* To make a good plan, we want as few collisions as possible,
         and we want to use as few different heights as possible.

         A collision happens between the atoms moving in two rows.
         Specifically, let dst{1,2} and src{1,2} be the destination
         and source slots for the two atoms. Then:
             v1 = dst1 - src1
             v2 = dst2 - src2
             overlap = ... XXX they are overlapping ...

             collision = sign(v1) != sign(v2) && overlap

        Actually this doesn't work: One atom moving to the right
        might need to cross a slower-moving atom also moving to
        the right.
        If it did work, we could fix all this pretty simply by just
        putting all the stuff with positive sign at height ~1 and
        with negative sign at 1. This is what I'm currently doing,
        actually. *)

    (* The main act of anagramming (a phrase) is picking a word
       that can be made with the remaining letters in our set,
       then subtracting those letters from the set, and repeating.
       We'll call this an "eligible" word.

       We can find all the eligible words by looping over the entire
       dictionary, but that's wasteful because many words will be
       ineligible (especially when we have few letters remaining).

       So here we can create an eligibility tree. Take all the
       clusters above as leaves. Each cluster is a set of words
       and the exact set of letters that they contain. The words
       are eligible if the remaining letters are a superset of
       the letters in the set.

       Say we have two clusters

       rs5'?  = sky, flus
       rs5'.? = sizy, juts, just, fish

       These could be joined into a node containing the
       intersection of the sets.

          rs5'.?
          | |
          | +- rs5'? = sky, flus
          +--- rs5'.? = skizy, juts, just, fish

       The joined node means: "If you don't have at least these
       letters remaining, you won't be able to match any words in this
       subtree." We can always join two subtrees together (the intersection
       is always defined), until we get a tree for the entire dictionary
       (likely rooted with the empty set). There are two things to tend
       to when considering the quality of the tree:
        - The intersection operation is lossy; if the set gets too small
       then we have to search it for many cases where it won't end up
       being useful.
        - The tree should be balanced; search will always be linear
       if the tree structure is linear.

       Without any guarantees, a simple way to do this is to
       repeatedly take two trees of similar size and merge them. This
       could be done pretty efficiently by keeping a set (heap) of
       trees ordered by size (depth?) and then plucking off the two
       smallest ones and joining them. This would not do a good job
       of maximizing the size of the new intersected roots, though.

       We could also do this by insertion. Start with any tree, and
       insert clusters into it. Say we have

                    s1
                   /  \            inserting s
                  s2  s3

       We can insert s anywhere (well, anywhere we have a null child),
       but along the entire path we must intersect s with the interior
       node's set. At each steo how do we choose which node to descend
       into? We could pick the one that has the larger intersection,
       perhaps breaking ties by descending into the smaller of the two
       trees.

       Finally, note that there's no reason for the tree to be binary,
       and there's no meaningful ordering being used between the
       children. So when we insert, if the intersections with the
       existing children are too lossy, we could just insert an
       additional child. By the pigeonhole principle, if there are N
       (number of atoms) non-empty children of some node, at least one
       of them must have a non-empty intersection with any given set.
       So N makes a natural branching factor?
