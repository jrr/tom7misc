This is source code for my 2008 PhD dissertation, "Modal Types for
Mobile Code." You can find a PDF at: http://tom7.org/papers/

To run this, you need:
 - To install mlton
 - To also check out the "sml-lib" directory from my subversion
   repository, and place it next to the "lambda5onrails" directory
   (this current one).

You should be able to build the server (server/) and compiler
(ml5pgh/) by running make in those subdirectories. Then you can build
tests like

./ml5pgh test/wiki.ml5

from the ml5pgh directory.

When server5 is running, http://localhost:5555/demos will contain the
index of demos. Note that you won't be able to see the compiled code
nor run them if you haven't compiled them.

As of 2017, this all still seems to work. Make sure that the -host
parameter is set properly for server5, since any external clients will
be instructed to connect to this host. (The default, "localhost", will
work but then only a browser on your local machine will find the
server at the address "localhost"). If you get an "assuming
termination" message for the demos, it is probably a related
connectivity problem.
