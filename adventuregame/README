   Adventuregame Test                Tom 7      15 Feb 2006

This is a test of infrastructure for building (sierra/lucasarts-style)
adventure games in Flash. Unfortunately, one cannot run or edit this
software without the Flash editor. Ultimately I abandoned it because
of some weird bugs with Flash and its worldwide deprecation. I wrote
a more complete and working javascript-based engine for Ludum Dare
in 2018; see the directory ../space/.

Status: Some very basic things work (doors between rooms, scaling of
player, messages). Some other critical features are not yet in place,
such as working inventory. If Flash still works for you and you want
to play it, try the compiled versions at: http://spacebar.org/flash/
