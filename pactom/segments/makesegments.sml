      (* Because we have to cross gates in order, gate matching is
         done with a state machine. As we run through an activity
         we can have a number of active gatestates. Each one tells
         us the last time we ran through the start gate, and how
         many of the gates we've correctly passed through since that.

         If we've been through gates 0 (the start gate), 1, and 2,
         then the gatestate records the time we went through gate 0,
         and the index 2. When we pass through gate 3 we can advance
         that index to 3. If instead we see gate 4, we ignore it (we
         may pass through it again later). If we see gate 1 again,
         there's no point in doing anything, since it just makes us
         ineligible to pass through gate 3 next and doesn't affect
         our time (which is determined by the passage through gate 0).
         If we see gate 0, we start a new gatestate (since this DOES
         affect our time). However, it supersedes any gatestate
         currently at index 0. So we only need to keep track of the
         latest one.

         As a result of all that, there is at one most gatestate per
         gate index. So we just store a flat array, parallel with
         the gates, except for the unnecessary final gate. *)

         apart (especially when the GPS device merges collinear
         points). Also compute the fraction (in 0, 1) of the
         segment pos1->pos2 that yields the approximate intersection
