This program converts type-1 standard MIDI files into MML, to be used
as input to "mckc," which compiles them into Nintendo Sound File (NSF)
format. I made it for a Nintendo music competition, since I can't
understand how anyone can compose by typing notes into a text file! ;)

It's written in SML. SML is great for this kind of stuff.

 ** How to compile

This program is quite unfinished, but it works. You'll need my sml-lib
to compile:

http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/tom7misc/sml-lib/

 or

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/tom7misc login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/tom7misc co sml-lib

 in a directory parallel to the one containing these sources.


The software should build with SML/NJ. Type 

CM.make' "midimml.cm";

at the prompt, and then use the functions in the Inst structure.

However, I highly suggest using mlton to make standalone executables
(the compiler is also much less buggy). To do this, go to the cygwin (or
bash) prompt and just type "make".
