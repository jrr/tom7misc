cc-lib                             Tom 7       4 Jun 2017

Like my much more impressive "sml-lib", this is my attempt to get
all of my frequently used C++ libraries into a single place so that
different copies don't accumulate different changes.

I try to use portable style where possible to make compiling against
this easy. I hate complicated makefiles, actually basically all build
systems, library dependencies, autoconf, and that stuff. But ultimately
it's kind of complicated, you know?

I'm pretty much on C++11 everywhere now, so these libraries may use
C++11 features. It's worth it. GCC 4.8 and later have pretty complete
support. As of 2016 I've started using C++14 too. On Windows, I'm using
TDM-GCC. On linux, just get the newest GCC.

Some of what's here is google "base" libraries, since those are quite
useful and I know them well. They have been released multiple times
under open-source licenses; particularly the Apache 2.0 license, which
is in APACHE20. Googletest is the "new BSD" license, in gtest/LICENSE.

Sean Barrett's excellently simple stb_* libraries are in the public
domain; see the notices at the tops of those files. I've made some
modifications to them. I've imported some other single-file libs and
modified them, like dr_wav.

Some of the numerical routines in randutil are based on Numpy. If you
believe that this is a "copy" or "substantial portion", then please
abide by Numpy's permissive license; see NUMPY.LICENSE.

The base64 and md5 code originally came from the public domain utilities;
I've only made light changes there, and let's call those public domain
as well.

The re2 subdirectory comes from Google and community contributors; see
re2/LICENSE for its permissive license.

Currently, everything else is licensed under the GPL, which can be
found in COPYING.

base/        Google "base" library. APACHE20 license.
strings/     Google "strings" library. APACHE20 license.
sdl/         Utilities for my habits in SDL. Includes bitmap font rendering.
jdksmidi/    Baroque but thorough MIDI library, GPL.
city/        The excellent CityHash hash algorithm.
gtest/       Google testing library. New BSD license.
re2/         Local copy of a good, free Regular Expression library.

wavesave      - Saves an array of audio samples as a WAV file. Limited input
                formats, though it is not hard to add more.
util          - General C++ utilities, accumulated throughout the ages. Some
                are pretty embarrassing and should be cleaned up/out.
heap          - Implementation of binary heaps.
textsvg       - Pretty trivial support for generating SVG files manually.
arcfour       - Implementation of the ARCFOUR (alleged RC4) algorithm, which
                is a fast and simple cryptographic-ish random stream generator.
timer         - Utterly trivial timer, in need of further development.
randutil      - Random number utilities, using arcfour for random byte
                generation.
vector-util   - Some basic utilities on vectors that only depend on portable
                stl.
rle           - (Custom) run-length encoding and decoding.
threadutil    - Utilities for threaded programming. These are mostly convenience
                methods; if you want to do anything fancy you'll probably want
                to be managing thread lifetimes yourself.
interval-tree - Stores intervals on a 1D number line, with an efficient query
                for intervals that contain a given point.
color-util    - Does that one thing you always need to do: Convert HSV to RGB.
lines         - Draw lines using Bresenham's algorithm.
base64        - Very simple base64 encoding and decoding.
md5           - Simple interface to MD5 hash algorithm. Note that MD5 should
                no longer be considered safe for cryptography, so you should
                probably avoid it for new applications.
bounds        - Simple bounding box implementation, typically used for
                generating plots of data
