sml/
      At some point, I thought that the reason that SML wasn't popular
      was that there wasn't a long-winded tutorial that avoided the
      type theory and concentrated on stuff I think "hackers" like,
      and which then ends abruptly because I got tired of writing it.

misc/
      spook.lines - a list of keywords which you can put in
                    emails to thwart electronic surveillance
                    systems, such as those deployed by the
                    US government (Carnivore/DCS1000). This
                    is meant to work with emacs, and since it
                    is a modified version of an emacs file,
                    is distributed under the terms of the
                    GPL. (see COPYING-GPL)
