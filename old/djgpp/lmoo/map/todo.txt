Easy: add more toolbar stuff.

needed for 1.0:
fix multiple tilesets! Aaaargh.
maplimp commands which show/hide layers.
fix copying of parts in resize-map
edit object file
History in console. Up/Down to go between them.
Fix scrollback in console.
make that status bar with x/y/tile be a different window and update it
          when the mouse moves etc.
do drawstyles. (drawstyle randomlist 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 3)
fix the /************/'s and FIXME's.
find out some better way of organizing the windows. Define constants
Is calculation of tile position from mousepos one off? Try to draw with

limp-to-do:
more tolerant of whitespace ie ( + 1 2 3)

whitespace.)
really looks for closing parentheses ie (help
