This is a mini-fork of Simon Windmill's "Leech" extension for Mozilla 
(leech.mozdev.org) that I made in 2003. It works in Mozilla Firebird and 
has some other small tweaks. Ha ha, I called it Firebird, which shows 
you how old this thing is! I'm sure it doesn't work any more, and you 
can probably find a much better download extension out there.
