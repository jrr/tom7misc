A long time ago Jacob and I started to write a free
multi-game-multi-player system for board games. The main app was to be
a (already completed) clone of MetaSquares. MetaCreations threatened
to sue us, and we eventually got distracted by other projects and
college, so this is as far as we got. Should need Borland C++ Builder
to compile, but I haven't used that in ages...

At this time in my life I liked to give software "funny", revulsive 
names like "poop." It probably stood for P-something Object Oriented 
Program. I was in College at the time, ostensibly an adult.

Code in the GPL.
