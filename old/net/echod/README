This is echod. It listens on a port (specified on the command line),
and anyone connecting to that port now speaks to anyone else connected
to that port (except themselves). For instance, 6 users telnet'd to
the port could use it as a chat server.

This program is primarily intended to be used in conjunction with my
win32 whiteboard program.

It should be rewritten to use the getconn() function of tsockets, to
avoid the huge mess that's there now.
