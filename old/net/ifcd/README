Internet Froodnet Chatnet Daemon

This software is in extremely infant stages, and the source code is
available only so folks can toy with it. It is undocumented; what few
source comments exist should probably be considered misleading at
best.

This software is distributed under the GPL and has no warranty (see
COPYING).

To install, download the newest backup.*.tar.gz (or all of the .cc, .h
files as well as the makefile, which tend to be newer, if slightly
less stable) and just type 'make' to compile. You'll probably want to
edit the source files to change some server parameters, actually,
first.

If you have difficulty compiling on a linux platform or similar
(please no complaints about compiling on Win32 or with a non-gcc/egcs
compiler), let me know. (tom7 at cs.cmu.edu)
