How to use Merchandise, the hacker's tile editor:

This program is for editing tiles from a Nintendo GameBoy ROM (.GB)
file. It requires that the tiles appear as raw data in the ROM image.
It allows you to discover the locations of tiles through a simple
process (ie., not scrolling through the entire ROM!).

Merchandise is written in Java and uses the Swing GUI library. You
need the Java SDK in order to compile it; if you have class files
then you only need a JVM. Comple it however you compile java programs
(javac *.java) and then run:

java MainWindow


You'll see a mostly empty screen.

Let's say you want to change the way your main character looks in your
favorite game. First we need to find where the graphics data is stored
in the ROM, so, use your favorite emulator (No Cash works well for this
since it has a great debugger and BG screen / OAM viewer) and find the
sprite. Gameboy tiles are 8 pixels by 8 pixels, and have 4 colors. What
you want to do is translate this tile into a piece of text, like this:

........
.*####*.
.#*++*#.
.#+.++#.
.#++++#.
.#*++*#.
.*####*.
........

. is for the lightest color pixel, typically white (or transparent for a sprite),
+ for the next darkest (typically light grey)
* for the next darkest (typically dark grey)
# for the darkest (typically black).

Be careful, since the palettes can be re-mapped so that they don't
follow the typical color scheme. The game boy also has the ability to
flip tiles horizontally and vertically, so a debugger really comes in
handy here. Finally, many games will compress large graphics, which
makes this method totally useless.

Once you have the tile, press the "find" button to open a dialog.
In the box at the top, type the full path to your ROM file.
In the larger box, paste your ASCII art graphic of the tile. (You can
paste many here to find several, if you like.) Click the "find" button.

If you guessed about pixels correctly, you should hopefull see one or
more copy of the tile in the grid on the left.

If there is one copy, that's perfect.

If there is more than one copy, then that could be a problem; the
tiles may be stored in the ROM more than once, or it could appear by
chance in several places. (An all-blank tile, represented by 16 '0'
bytes, for instance will appear tons of times in a ROM.) You might
use the method below to look at tiles near the candidate tiles...

If there are no hits, try searching for a mirror image of the tile, or
permuting the colors. It is also possible that the graphics are
compressed and that nothing will work...

The find function can also take literal addresses. Just write the
decimal offset of the tile that has your interest in (parentheses):

(32768)

You can include a run of tiles like so:

(32768:10)

That loads the tile at 32768 and then 9 after it.

The find function will also ignore any [comments in brackets].


If you click the 'find' button again, you'll notice that it has
changed the text to be the literal addresses of the tiles that
it found. Continue using this method until you have found all of
the tiles that you're interested in.


Now, we can use the larger grid at the right to edit the tiles.
Most GameBoy graphics are larger than 8x8, so what you'll want
to do is arrange the 8x8 tiles you found into a larger graphic
for editing. Click on the tiles at the left, and then click
into cells on the right in order to make the graphic. If
you are editing a repeating tile (a background graphic), it
will probably help to place several down; edits will affect
all of them and you can see how it blends in with adjacent
copies of itself.

If you like, press the "clear" button at the bottom, which
will reset all tiles that you've placed on the grid on the
right. (In other words, it makes them all blank white and
ready for drawing.)

Now, you can use the mouse and the drawing keys to edit the tiles:

Keys: 
1: start drawing with color 1   (.)
2: start drawing with color 2   (+)
3: start drawing with color 3   (*)
4: start drawing with color 4   (#)

When you're happy with your edits, press "patch" to modify the ROM
file loaded with "find".

If you're unhappy, well, try 'find' again to reload the tiles from
the ROM. 

Tips:

There's no UNDO, so be careful!

Be careful, since gameboy games often flip tiles horizontally and
vertically. Make sure that your edits make sense, or you may waste
a lot of time!
