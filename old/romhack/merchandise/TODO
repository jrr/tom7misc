Don:

* Copy/paste tiles (regions would be sweet)
* Shift contents of tile up/down/left/right (very common for animation)
* Multiple layouts (right side of screen), switchable with Q,W,E,R,T keys.
  I can use this to switch between animation frames on different "layers"
* Status bar to give information (current draw mode, layer, 
				  mouseover tile -> its offset)
* Scrollbar for left grid. (Try loading (0:99999)).

Tom:

* Find dialog makes use of ranges (32768:128)

Don or Tom:

* Pokemon (de)compression??
