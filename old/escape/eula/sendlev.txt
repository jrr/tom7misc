                              Sending Levels


     If you have any levels which you have made, feel free to send them
my way! The Escape package includes the proprietary XENCODE and XDECODE
programs, which will encode levels into mailable text format. You can also
use UUENCODE, or attach the levels to an e-mail in AOL or MIME format.
(XENCODE is probably the best to use, because it is standardized and
compresses the levels) Please note that I cannot accept a level which I
cannot beat. This means that you should do one of the following:

 ў Send me a solution in the e-mail message. This can be like "1U3R4D2U"
(1 up, 3 right, 4 down, 2 up) etc. This will do fine.

 ў Send me a solution macro recorded in the game. This is the best way
except that the macro recording is not "supported". (It's there, just be
careful!) The macros can be mailed in any of the normal manners. (see above)
To record a macro, you press Alt-R; playback is with Alt-P. Alt-S toggles
step playback mode. 

 ў Pray that you can beat it on your own. I am pretty good at these things,
but I won't spend more than a few minutes on it if I'm not
even sure it's possible. If you want me to try to beat it on my own, you
can send me a solution macro, with which I can test to see if the level
is possible without watching. Then I'll try. =)

     Also, do not forget to include your name and e-mail address! If you
don't want this information accompanying the level, just let me know.
Levels which I receive, if they are decent, will most likely be put in
the Escape User Level Archive, free for downloading. This archive will
also be included for registered users and people who send me a SASE and blank
disk. (Note that the levels will be offered for free; registered users are
not paying for your levels, they are merely included free.)

Here's a form to fill out when you submit levels (just an example; do
whatever you want):

Real Name:   ____________________ [ ] I want this to appear with the level.

E-mail:      ____________________ [ ] I want this to appear with the level.

Home Page:   ____________________ [ ] I want this to appear with the level.

Level Title: ____________________

Filename:    ____________________

Suggested Difficulty Rating:

[ ] Easy   [ ] Tricky   [ ] Hard   [ ] Painful

This is where to send the levels:

ў ImightbeTM@aol.com - This is the best place and will get the fastest
response.

ў Mail a disk to:

ў Upload them via FTP to members.aol.com:/spoons1000/incoming - I rarely
check here but if you are sending a large amount of levels this is a good
place to do it (please compress them in ZIP/ARJ/LZH format, though). You
should also drop me an e-mail at ImightbeTM@aol.com telling me that they
are there.
