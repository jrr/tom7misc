I wrote these back in 1995 when I was learning x86 assembly (for my
"hacking" group the "East Coast Hacking Organization", hah). Those
were the good old days, where drawing to the screen just meant writing
to a location in memory.

I was surprised to find the original TASM sources compiled in MASM
with only trivial changes. (Changed ROR AX,2 to two ROR AX,1
instructions, changed push/pop reg1 reg2 to separate push/pop
instructions.)

Run c.bat to compile all the programs. You can get MASM for free
through various places on Microsoft's site; do a search and you'll
find it.

These programs are in the public domain and come with ABSOLUTELY NO
WARRANTY.
