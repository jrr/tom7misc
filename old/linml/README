This is a quick implementation of the LinML programming language
(MinML-like language with concurrency, communication, and linear
types). It's not meant for writing actual programs (it has no parser),
nor would you really want to. But there is some neat stuff in it to
play around with nonetheless.

See "Linear Types for Communication" (Murphy '02 at
http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/papers/) for formal semantics and
detailed description.

If you don't know about linear types, you should learn about them!
