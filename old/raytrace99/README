This is a raytracer that I wrote for a computer graphics class in 
college. I think some of the animations I made with it are still 
"featured" on spacebar.org. At the time (isn't this true?) I liked to 
give myself self-flagellative extra challenges, so instead of using the 
C++ starter code that they gave us for the project, I wrote the whole 
thing in Standard ML. I've never felt good at geometry, so I struggled a 
bunch with the spatial data structures like octrees, and no doubt the 
ray tracer has some canceling sign errors and things like that.
