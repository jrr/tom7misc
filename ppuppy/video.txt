Slides TODO has moved to deconstruct.talk.



free jokes etc:
 eeprom is like kirby
 lolol = lolo
 refer to cartridges as "tapes"
 let's take a look at the NES's soft, vulnerable underbelly

Overall arc:
  Introduction
   -> get weird
   -> photosensitivity warning
   -> credentials / where I'm coming from
   -> emotional rollercoaster?
   
   -> software/hardware, funny, connections
   -> this funny concept of "improper hierarchy"

  Technical stuff
   -> describe the NES, just enough to explain
      the technical contribution
   -> bicameral mind
   -> emulation.
   -> in addition to being literally "retro", emulation
      is like the joke of "retro"
  Demonstration

  Future work
   -> sound
   -> reverse emulating the CPU
  Big ideas
   -> so this is a nice way to honor hardware that I have
      some nostalgia for. It's not really that useful,
      which I completely admit. But I think in addition
      to being this idea that you might see elsewhere,
      like security, it could tell us something about
   -> so I just wanna leave you with a "big idea" about
      how this 


self-reference is not itself funny. "Hi, my name is Tom."

retro is not funny. the present already contains the past.
anachronism is funny: it's wrong, a surprise, that something
from the future exists in the past

mario eating a boot is not funny
mario eating tide pods
or better yet,  samus eating tide pods

emotional rollercoaster / meta spoilers
 - First I'm going to tell you something that sounds impressive,
   then you will be disappointed when you find out I "cheated",
   then you will perhaps be impressed again when you find out
   how hard it was even to cheat,
   and then you will be disappointed with the actual results,
   and then you might be happy again to discover that it's not
   really "cheating"


I'm pretty old. Like I think of subversion as the new good
version of CVS.

* hardware
 - I figured out why it's called "hard"-ware
 - temperature dependent
 - logic families
 - schottky transistors
 - "put 0 on the wire"

* improper hierarchy
 - actually anachronism is an example
 - the extreme example of this is a "loop" (hofstadter calls
   this a "strange loop")
 - e.g. a quine,
 - Y combinator
 - but improper hierarchy is a more general case.
 - venn diagram
      - (is this a hierarchy itself that we could violate?)
      - also self-promotion pro-tip: Look how I can now just
        put my name next to these geniuses and draw an implicit
        parallel!
      - also look how big my venn blob is?!
 - many examples (these need fleshing out!)
    - compiler
    - 64-bit windows 7 running on VirtualBox on windows 2000.
    - cd/tape adapter
    -
 - the cart has a schematic of itself inside its own ROM
 - the signal being sent over the wires contains an image
   of the oscilloscope sampling the signal over those wires
    - could even be live??

!! DANGER!!
 we're gonna do some dangerous things

* circuit board
 - these little goombas are capacitors

* describing how the ppu works
 - possible to display a quine? (screen image that displays
   its own description (i.e., hex nametable/attribute table?)

* timing
 - Can't make the conference deadline? Just submit so late that
   it arrives in time for next year's.
 - and how do we measure latency? We use the ping command.


* who's in charge here?
- so many different processors; which one is "in charge"?
   does it matter?

* reverse emulation
- "in fact this behavior is required by law" (show sticker on the
  back of game/console)



* miscellaneous

"wrongness in computer science"

"memory knocking"
Could use this to signal the beginning of the frame,
also to communicate 

actually this reminds me of why I gave up on security
obviously I didn't like just think of this and make the
slide this second. i mean when I was making the slides.
 - one transistor bug
 - DLL signature knocking

does mod come up? use upside-down POW block.
  (yes: mirroring)

* brainterfaces
 - How TVs work: connected to neural interfaces, and 
 - Persistence of vision = bus capacitance
 - remember the ABCs but it's something else
 - mother brain


First "wing it" version:
 - intro: 22m09s
 - how nes works: 19m10s
 - reverse emulating it: 30m31s
 - getting inputs, security, conclusion: 38m40s

cool so only 110 minutes, 4.4x the requested length (:
