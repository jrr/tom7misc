             Tape                                 1 Jul 2018

This software generates markers (as SVG to print out on a laser printer, etc.) that
are believed to be compatible with the Shaper Origin CNC device. It may or may not
work for you.

I have no relation with Shaper and this tape is presumably not endorsed by them.
