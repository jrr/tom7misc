 - the dots in the corners seem to always be present?

 - mm seems wrong, although it is close. measuring
   corner dot to corner dot I get 1.500 inch, which
   is 15 grid cells wide. so 0.1 inch grid. Close to 2.5mm,
   which I tried before and it crashed shaper (:

 - there ARE repeated patterns even on a single roll of
   tape. I just happened to see

   * * * *   *   *
   * * *         *

   oh just kidding, the other one is this same but mirrored
   along the short axis. So, not really the same.

 - Not all the hand-made "random" markers worked. All of the scanned
   ones have even parity (white dot = 1 bit), and all but one of the
   unscanned ones have odd. So I think they are supposed to have even
   parity, and maybe some other property like a maximum number of dots.

 - If the corners are always on, then we have 12 bits of entropy, but
   minus one so that we have parity. That's only 2^11 = 2048 different
   markers, not even counting rotational symmetry!

 - On my first sheet, it scanned this marker

     * * * *   * * *
     *   * * * * * *

   but NOT this one:

     * * * * * *   *
     * * *   * * * *

   Note that they are the same under rotation. How is this possible?
   Does it reject the second one it sees in the same scan? It can't
   possibly care about rotation, right?

 - It's not the case that parity is preserved for top or bottom row.

 - It's not the case that any bits but the corners are always set,
   unless perhaps some orientation canonicalization is done. Binary
   AND of the scanned list is 0x8181, the corners.

 - It's so simple! popcount = 6. I think sometimes a marker with more
   dots will scan, because it does "contain" a valid marker after all.

 - Ah, also: Rotationally symmetric markers are rejected, which does
   make sense.
