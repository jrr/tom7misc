Search for really interesting games in the lichess database
e.g. largest comeback game
longest king walk
piece ends up on rare square
most queens on the board
long forced mates (missed?)
solid clumps of pieces
just plain "weird" positions based on their total probability
  using heatmaps

find interesting games
 - quadrupled pawns or more
 - lots of pieces, all advanced off the back rank(s)
 - one pawn captures the most number of pieces
 - naked castling
 - castling to mate!
 - en passant to mate!
 - most queens
 - promotion not to queen

find positions that are reached in two games but after long divergence
(and have a minimum number of pieces or whatever)
- like generally, build a thing that lets you "score" games/positions
   or sets of games, and then it finds the best with that quality, a la
   mapreduce

find powerful patterns; arrangements of pieces (e.g. alekhine's gun) that
tend to lead to wins

- bad chess engines: just use the probability maps
  from the previous to try to move pieces to squares where
  they are likely to survive.
