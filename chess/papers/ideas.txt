find interesting games
 - quadrupled pawns or more
 - lots of pieces, all advanced off the back rank(s)
 - one pawn captures the most number of pieces

find positions that are reached in two games but after long divergence
(and have a minimum number of pieces or whatever)
- like generally, build a thing that lets you "score" games/positions
   or sets of games, and then it finds the best with that quality, a la
   mapreduce

find powerful patterns; arrangements of pieces (e.g. alekhine's gun) that
tend to lead to wins
